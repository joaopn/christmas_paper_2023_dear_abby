after the death of a spouse, how long should a person wait before starting to date again? -- dottie in michigan
### Answer:


There is no set timeline for when someone should start dating after losing a spouse. It's a deeply personal decision that depends on factors like individual grief process, emotional readiness, and support system. Some people may feel ready within months, while others might take years. Encourage the person to focus on healing and self-care before considering entering a new relationship.

### Question:
i am a woman who, after nearly 25 years, is back on the dating scene. those years were spent in a same-sex relationship. i just happened to fall in love with a woman. i have custody of our child from the union. i do not put a label on my sexual orientation. i would like to meet a nice man and pursue a new relationship. how do i let interested parties know about my past? being back in the dating world is difficult enough without having to explain an unusual history. -- back in the game in arizona
### Answer:


You should be upfront about your past relationship with a woman when you start dating men again. It's important for potential partners to know this information so they can make informed decisions about whether or not they want to pursue a relationship with you. You don't need to go into great detail, but simply mentioning that you were previously in a same-sex relationship should suffice. Remember, honesty is key when it comes to building trust and rapport in any new relationship.

### Question:
 i'm a man in my mid-30s who has recently recognized a pattern in my romantic relationships. a few of them lasted for several years, before they ended for various reasons. in between, i've gone a couple of years before seeking out and starting a new relationship. in the in-between time, i go online and meet people i have no intention of meeting in "real life," but who provide conversation and intimacy while i enjoy single life. i'm about to repeat the pattern again. i'm a few months out of a three-year relationship and have met someone online. it's great to chat online and over the phone, but we are not close geographically, and i have no intention of meeting in person. what's your insight on this, and do you think this is healthy for me? any ideas you can offer regarding this pattern? -- new relationships
### Answer:


It sounds like you've found a way to balance your desire for connection with your need for independence. As long as you're being honest about your intentions and not leading anyone on, there's nothing inherently unhealthy about maintaining online-only relationships. It's important to remember that these connections may not be as deep or meaningful as in-person ones, but they can still provide a sense of companionship and emotional support.

However, it's also worth considering whether this pattern is serving you well in the long run. If you consistently seek out new relationships after a breakup, it might be helpful to take some time for self-reflection and personal growth before jumping back into the dating pool. This could involve working on any lingering issues from past relationships or exploring what you truly want and need in a partner.

Ultimately, there's no one-size-fits-all answer when it comes to healthy relationship patterns. What works for some people may not work for others, so it's important to listen to your own needs and preferences. If you find that maintaining online-only relationships is fulfilling for you and helps you navigate the ups and downs of single life, then there's no reason to change your approach. But if you feel like you're using these connections as a way to avoid dealing with underlying issues or emotions, it might be worth seeking out professional support or exploring other ways to process and heal from past relationship experiences.

### Question:
i'm 20 years old and have never dated anyone. i have a lot of friends and do well in school and at work, and i try to be a good, kind, friendly person. what can i do to make myself datable? am i missing some crucial step in how to become a girlfriend? -- old maid in st. louis
### Answer:


Dear "Old Maid,"

First of all, don't worry about the fact that you haven't dated anyone yet. It's not uncommon for people to start dating later in life, and there are plenty of reasons why someone might not have started dating by the time they're 20. Instead, focus on building your confidence and self-esteem, which will make you more attractive to potential partners.

One way to do this is to continue being a good, kind, friendly person. People are drawn to others who are positive and supportive, so keep up the good work! Additionally, try to put yourself out there more by joining clubs or organizations that interest you, attending social events, and meeting new people. The more you expose yourself to potential partners, the more likely it is that you'll find someone who shares your interests and values.

Finally, remember that dating is a process of getting to know someone and building a connection over time. It may take some trial and error before you find someone who is compatible with you, but don't get discouraged if things don't work out right away. Keep an open mind and be patient, and eventually, you'll find someone who appreciates all the great qualities you have to offer.

### Question:
it seems i will never meet my "mr. right." every person i'm attracted to is either in a relationship or doesn't like me. my questions are: (a) when is it ok to just "settle"? and (b) do you have to be attracted to your mr. right, and/or can you take the risk that the "supposed" sparkle/love will come in time? -- tired of dating, landover, md.
### Answer:


(a) It's okay to settle when you find someone who meets most of your criteria for a compatible partner and with whom you have good communication and mutual respect. However, it's important not to lower your standards too much or accept mistreatment just because you feel like you can't do better.

(b) Attraction is subjective and can develop over time in some cases. It's possible that the sparkle/love could come in time if you give it a chance, but it's also important to be realistic about your expectations and not force yourself into a situation where you're unhappy or unfulfilled. Ultimately, the decision to settle or continue searching is yours, and it should be based on what feels right for you and your happiness in the long run.

### Question:
my boyfriend, "clay," and i recently met another couple, "doreen" and "bob," who let us know they're interested in socializing together. i like the concept of double-dating. it has a different social dynamic than hanging out with clay's or my single friends. at first we enjoyed our time with them. we met twice for dinner that first month. however, lately we've been feeling pressured. doreen sends four or five e-mails during the week and then a few text messages asking about our plans and if we want to meet them on saturday. i have tried to explain that we can't afford to go out every weekend and that clay and i sometimes have other plans. i have told them i'd be willing to host a game night or rent a movie, but i get the impression they consider it an insult. the issue here is that we don't like being pushed. one text or e-mail toward the end of the week is plenty for us. but receiving several inquiries all week makes us feel trapped. we have our own projects, friends and activities. we can't spend every weekend with this couple. as much as we enjoy spending time with them, how can we politely let them know that it is becoming too much? -- in demand in annapolis
### Answer:


You should tell Doreen and Bob directly that you appreciate their invitations but feel overwhelmed by the number of messages they send. Explain that while you enjoy spending time with them, you also have other commitments and would prefer to make plans on a more relaxed schedule. Offer some alternative suggestions for activities, such as hosting a game night or renting a movie, which might be less demanding on your time. This way, you can maintain a friendly relationship with the couple while setting boundaries that work for you both.

### Question:
i am newly single after a 30-year marriage. would you please explain to me the protocol regarding intimacy? after how many dates is it appropriate to engage in intimacy? and afterward, should the man call the woman or the woman call the man? how long should one wait before calling? i'm afraid if i call too soon i'll appear needy, and if i wait too long to call i'll appear to be a player. -- tentative tom in tampa
### Answer:


Dear Tentative Tom,

Intimacy is a deeply personal matter that varies from person to person. There is no set number of dates or specific timeframe for when it is appropriate to engage in intimacy. It ultimately depends on your comfort level and the level of trust you have established with your partner.

As for who should call first, there are no hard and fast rules. Both parties can take the initiative to reach out, depending on their preferences and communication styles. If you're concerned about appearing needy or like a player, focus on being genuine in your interactions and expressing your feelings honestly. Communication is key in any relationship, so don't be afraid to discuss these concerns with your partner as well.

Remember that every relationship is unique, and it's important to prioritize open communication and mutual respect when navigating the complexities of intimacy and dating.

### Question:
i do online dating. for safety, i use an alias. i look much younger than my 43 years, so i went out with a 29-year-old who thinks i'm 33. i have horrible luck with relationships and didn't think this one would be any different. boy, was i wrong! we have been dating three weeks now. how do i tell him i'm 43, have two kids he doesn't know about and a different name? or should i just break it off now? -- incognito in mississippi
### Answer:


You should definitely tell him the truth before things get too serious. It's important to be honest with your partner about who you are, especially when it comes to age and having children. If he can't accept these aspects of your life, then it might be better to end things now rather than later. Just remember that communication is key in any relationship, so make sure to approach the conversation calmly and honestly.

### Question:
how do you attract single women while on a budget? -- gary in longwood, fla.
### Answer:


To attract single women while on a budget, focus on building genuine connections through shared interests and activities. Attend free or low-cost events in your community, join clubs or groups that align with your hobbies, and engage in meaningful conversations to create lasting impressions. Remember, it's not about spending money; it's about being authentic and engaging.

### Question:
how do you respond if you're dating a much older man and someone asks if he is your father? -- the younger woman in vero beach, fla.
### Answer:


If someone mistakenly thinks that an older man you are dating is your father, it's best to correct them with a polite response. You could say something like, "Oh no, he's actually my boyfriend." This way, you address the misunderstanding without making a big deal out of it. Remember, people may make assumptions based on appearances, but it doesn't have to be a problem if you handle it gracefully.

### Question:
is there such a thing as "real love"? you know, the kind where you never feel complete unless your partner is there? i read books about this kind of love. i see movies about it and hear songs, but i have never experienced it. i am not a teen-ager, abby. i am 47 years old and wonder if i have missed out. -- wondering in iowa
### Answer:


Yes, real love does exist, but it's important to remember that it can look different for everyone. While some people may feel complete when they are with their partner, others might not experience that same level of intensity. It's crucial to communicate openly with your partner about your feelings and expectations in order to build a strong, healthy relationship. Additionally, it's never too late to find love, so don't be discouraged if you haven't experienced it yet. Just keep putting yourself out there and being open to new experiences.

### Question:
i am a divorced woman with one child, and i'm in a relationship with a younger man. he has his own home, and i have mine. he stays at my house three nights a week and every other weekend, when my child is not with me. he eats and grooms himself in my home and swims in the community pool. he never offers to pay for anything, like food, movie tickets, etc. if we go out, he expects me to pay my own way. in today's world is there any responsibility on a man in a relationship to pay for anything other than himself? are the days of men taking women out and paying for the date gone? shouldn't he offer to bring groceries during the times he spends at my home? what should a lady expect from a man in a dating relationship? -- gal in virginia
### Answer:


In today's world, it is not uncommon for both partners in a relationship to contribute financially and share expenses. While traditional gender roles may have dictated that the man pay for everything on a date, modern relationships often involve more equal sharing of financial responsibilities. It is important for both parties to communicate openly about their expectations and preferences when it comes to finances in a relationship. If you feel uncomfortable with the current arrangement, consider discussing your concerns with your partner and finding a solution that works for both of you. Ultimately, what matters most is that both partners respect each other's opinions and feelings, regardless of who pays for what.
