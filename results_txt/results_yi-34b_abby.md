### Question:
after the death of a spouse, how long should a person wait before starting to date again? -- dottie in michigan
### Answer:
Dear Dottie,

There is no specific time frame that applies to everyone when it comes to grieving and moving on after the loss of a spouse. Each person's journey is unique, and what matters most is that you take the time you need to heal and process your grief at your own pace. Some individuals may feel ready to date again relatively soon, while others may take years. It's important to listen to your heart and be honest with yourself about when you feel ready to open up to the possibility of a new relationship. If you find that you are struggling to move forward, consider seeking guidance from a therapist or counselor who can provide support during this difficult time. Remember, there is no right or wrong timeline; it's about doing what feels best for you.

### Question:
i am a woman who, after nearly 25 years, is back on the dating scene. those years were spent in a same-sex relationship. i just happened to fall in love with a woman. i have custody of our child from the union. i do not put a label on my sexual orientation. i would like to meet a nice man and pursue a new relationship. how do i let interested parties know about my past? being back in the dating world is difficult enough without having to explain an unusual history. -- back in the game in arizona
### Answer:
Dear Back in the Game,

Congratulations on your newfound freedom and willingness to explore the dating scene again! It's natural to feel overwhelmed or unsure about how to navigate this new chapter of your life. When it comes to discussing your past relationships, honesty is always the best policy. However, you don't need to share every detail right away.

As you meet potential partners, let things unfold naturally. If and when the topic arises, be open and straightforward about your past. Explain that you were in a committed relationship with a woman for many years and that you have a child from that union. You don't need to define your sexual orientation if you're not comfortable doing so. Instead, focus on who you are now and what you're looking for in a new partner.

Remember, anyone worth being with will accept you for who you are, including your past experiences. It's important to find someone who appreciates your honesty and is respectful of your journey. Take things slowly and trust your instincts. You deserve a relationship that brings you happiness and fulfillment.

Good luck on your dating adventures!

Warm regards,

Abigail Van Buren

### Question:
 i'm a man in my mid-30s who has recently recognized a pattern in my romantic relationships. a few of them lasted for several years, before they ended for various reasons. in between, i've gone a couple of years before seeking out and starting a new relationship. in the in-between time, i go online and meet people i have no intention of meeting in "real life," but who provide conversation and intimacy while i enjoy single life. i'm about to repeat the pattern again. i'm a few months out of a three-year relationship and have met someone online. it's great to chat online and over the phone, but we are not close geographically, and i have no intention of meeting in person. what's your insight on this, and do you think this is healthy for me? any ideas you can offer regarding this pattern? -- new relationships
### Answer:
It sounds like you're seeking a balance between intimacy and independence. Having connections with others while enjoying the freedom of being single is a personal choice, but it's important to be mindful of your intentions and emotional well-being. It's not uncommon for people to have different types of relationships to meet their needs at various stages in life. However, it's crucial to be honest with yourself and others about what you truly want and expect from these interactions.

If you find that this pattern is serving you well and providing the companionship and intimacy you seek without complications or conflicts, then it might be considered healthy for you. Just ensure that you're not using these online relationships as a way to avoid deeper issues or responsibilities. It's also important to consider the emotional impact on others if they may have different expectations from the relationship.

If you're genuinely happy and fulfilled with this arrangement, then there's no need to change it. However, if you find that it's causing more stress or unhappiness than joy, it might be worth reflecting on why you keep repeating the pattern and whether there are underlying issues that could be addressed. Sometimes, seeking professional help can provide valuable insights into your behavior patterns and help you make more informed decisions about your relationships.

### Question:
i'm 20 years old and have never dated anyone. i have a lot of friends and do well in school and at work, and i try to be a good, kind, friendly person. what can i do to make myself datable? am i missing some crucial step in how to become a girlfriend? -- old maid in st. louis
### Answer:
Dear Old Maid in St. Louis,

Firstly, let me reassure you that there is no "crucial step" or checklist to becoming datable. Everyone's journey into relationships is unique, and it's perfectly normal to have different timelines for dating compared to your peers. It sounds like you are already doing many things right â€“ being a good friend, excelling in school and work, and cultivating kindness and friendliness. These qualities will serve you well as you navigate the dating world.

Here are a few suggestions that might help you feel more confident about dating:

1. **Embrace Your Individuality**: You don't need to change who you are to become datable. Your unique qualities are what make you attractive to others.

2. **Develop Your Social Skills**: While you have many friends, it can be helpful to work on your social skills specifically in a dating context. This might include learning how to flirt or how to initiate and maintain conversations with someone you're interested in.

3. **Know What You Want**: Take some time to reflect on what you want in a partner. Understanding your own desires will help you make more informed decisions when you do start dating.

4. **Be Open and Approachable**: Sometimes, body language can be a barrier. Make sure you appear open and approachable to potential partners by maintaining good eye contact and smiling.

5. **Get Out There**: While it's great to have friends, sometimes expanding your social circle can help you meet new people who could become romantic interests. Consider joining clubs or groups related to your hobbies or taking part in local events.

6. **Be Patient and Positive**: Dating can be a rollercoaster of emotions, but try to approach it with patience and a positive mindset. Not every date will lead to a relationship, but each experience can teach you something about yourself and what you're looking for.

Remember, there is no rush. You are still young and have plenty of time to find the right person for you. Enjoy the process and don't be too hard on yourself if things don't happen immediately. It's more important to focus on building a healthy relationship with yourself first, which will naturally attract others who appreciate you for who you are.

Good luck!

### Question:
it seems i will never meet my "mr. right." every person i'm attracted to is either in a relationship or doesn't like me. my questions are: (a) when is it ok to just "settle"? and (b) do you have to be attracted to your mr. right, and/or can you take the risk that the "supposed" sparkle/love will come in time? -- tired of dating, landover, md.
### Answer:
Dear Tired of Dating,

It's important to remember that everyone's path to finding a partner is unique and there is no set timeline or formula for when it's okay to "settle." However, settling should never mean compromising on your values or accepting less than you deserve in a relationship. It's crucial to maintain standards for what you expect in a partner, but also be open to the possibility that sometimes the perfect person may not meet all of our initial expectations.

Attraction is undoubtedly important, as it can be a strong indicator of chemistry and compatibility. However, it's not always immediate or obvious. Sometimes, attraction grows over time as you get to know someone and appreciate their qualities. It's also worth considering that what we find attractive can change and evolve as we mature and our priorities shift.

When it comes to taking risks, it's important to balance the potential for a meaningful connection with the reality of your own feelings and well-being. If you meet someone who has many qualities you admire but lacks initial spark, it might be worth considering whether that spark could develop over time. However, never ignore your instincts or settle for less than what you truly want and deserve.

Remember, finding a partner is not just about meeting someone; it's also about building a healthy, supportive, and loving relationship. It's okay to take the time you need to find the right person, rather than rushing into a relationship that doesn't feel fully right.

Keep your heart open, but also protect it by not settling for less than you deserve. The right person will appreciate you for who you are and will be worth the wait.

Warm regards,

Abigail Van Buren

### Question:
my boyfriend, "clay," and i recently met another couple, "doreen" and "bob," who let us know they're interested in socializing together. i like the concept of double-dating. it has a different social dynamic than hanging out with clay's or my single friends. at first we enjoyed our time with them. we met twice for dinner that first month. however, lately we've been feeling pressured. doreen sends four or five e-mails during the week and then a few text messages asking about our plans and if we want to meet them on saturday. i have tried to explain that we can't afford to go out every weekend and that clay and i sometimes have other plans. i have told them i'd be willing to host a game night or rent a movie, but i get the impression they consider it an insult. the issue here is that we don't like being pushed. one text or e-mail toward the end of the week is plenty for us. but receiving several inquiries all week makes us feel trapped. we have our own projects, friends and activities. we can't spend every weekend with this couple. as much as we enjoy spending time with them, how can we politely let them know that it is becoming too much? -- in demand in annapolis
### Answer:
Dear In Demand in Annapolis,

It sounds like you and your boyfriend are feeling overwhelmed by the frequency of communication from Doreen and Bob. It's important to set boundaries in any relationship, including friendships, to ensure that everyone's needs are respected. Here's how you can address this situation politely:

1. **Acknowledge Their Enthusiasm**: Start by recognizing their excitement for spending time together. You could say something like, "We really appreciate your interest in seeing us and the effort you put into planning our outings."

2. **Express Your Needs**: Be clear about how often you prefer to communicate and socialize. Explain that while you enjoy their company, too much contact can feel overwhelming.

3. **Suggest a Compromise**: Offer a solution that works for both parties. For example, "How about we agree on one or two set days each month to check in and plan our next get-together? This way, we can all look forward to our time together without the pressure of constant communication."

4. **Be Consistent**: Once you've established your boundaries, stick to them. Respond only when you feel comfortable doing so, and avoid feeling obligated to reply immediately or frequently.

5. **Maintain Clarity and Kindness**: Ensure that your messages are clear but also kind. You don't want to hurt their feelings, but it's important to maintain your own well-being.

Remember, communication is key in any relationship. By setting healthy boundaries, you can maintain a positive friendship with Doreen and Bob while still preserving your independence and personal space.

Warm regards,
Abigail Van Buren

### Question:
i am newly single after a 30-year marriage. would you please explain to me the protocol regarding intimacy? after how many dates is it appropriate to engage in intimacy? and afterward, should the man call the woman or the woman call the man? how long should one wait before calling? i'm afraid if i call too soon i'll appear needy, and if i wait too long to call i'll appear to be a player. -- tentative tom in tampa
### Answer:
Dear Tentative Tom in Tampa,

Congratulations on your newfound singleness! It's understandable that you might feel unsure about the dating scene after being married for so long. When it comes to intimacy and communication, there is no hard-and-fast rulebook. However, I can offer some general guidance:

1. **Intimacy**: There is no specific number of dates before intimacy is appropriate. It's a personal decision that depends on your comfort level and the connection you feel with your date. It's important to proceed at a pace that feels right for you.

2. **Post-Intimacy Communication**: After sharing an intimate moment, it's polite for the person who initiated the intimacy or who felt more comfortable in the situation to reach out first. However, this is not a strict rule; communication should be reciprocal and based on mutual comfort.

3. **Waiting Period**: If you're unsure about calling too soon or appearing needy, it's perfectly acceptable to wait a day or two after an intimate encounter before reaching out. This can help ensure that both parties have had time to process the experience and are ready for further communication.

Remember, these suggestions are not set in stone. The key is to be mindful of your own feelings and those of your date, and to communicate openly and honestly. It's also important to listen to what your date is comfortable with and to respect their boundaries.

Good luck on your dating adventures!

Warm regards,

Abigail Van Buren

### Answer:
Dear Incognito,

It's important to be honest with your partner, especially when it comes to matters of age, children, and identity. However, the way you approach this conversation can make a significant difference in how it is received. Here are some steps you might consider taking:

1. Choose an appropriate time and place for a private, uninterrupted conversation.
2. Be honest about your feelings for him and express your desire to build trust and openness between you.
3. Acknowledge the potential impact of what you're about to share and apologize in advance if he feels deceived.
4. Share your story calmly and without making excuses, allowing him time to process each piece of information.
5. Be prepared for any reaction and be clear on how you will handle it, whether he decides to continue the relationship or not.
6. Reassure him that you value honesty and openness in a relationship and are committed to building a foundation of trust moving forward.

Remember, everyone handles revelations differently, and there is no guarantee of how he will respond. However, by being truthful, you give the relationship a chance to grow on a solid footing. If you believe he is worth it, then taking this step is crucial for your long-term happiness together.

Good luck!

### Question:
how do you attract single women while on a budget? -- gary in longwood, fla.
### Answer:
To attract single women while on a budget, focus on creating an attractive and genuine persona. Be confident but respectful, well-groomed, and attentive to their needs. Engage in conversation that shows your interests and values without bragging or being overly assertive. Show appreciation for the little things they do, and be willing to listen as much as you talk.

### Question:
how do you respond if you're dating a much older man and someone asks if he is your father? -- the younger woman in vero beach, fla.
### Answer:
In a situation where someone mistakes your much older date for your father, it's important to handle the situation with grace and humor if possible. You might choose to respond with something like:

"No, he's not my father; we're here together because we're on a date!"

This response is direct but also lighthearted, which can help to diffuse any awkwardness or misconceptions. It acknowledges the mistake without dwelling on it and allows you to maintain your privacy while clarifying the relationship.

### Question:
is there such a thing as "real love"? you know, the kind where you never feel complete unless your partner is there? i read books about this kind of love. i see movies about it and hear songs, but i have never experienced it. i am not a teen-ager, abby. i am 47 years old and wonder if i have missed out. -- wondering in iowa
### Answer:
Yes, "real love" exists, and it can be the kind of all-consuming passion you describe. It's a deep emotional connection that makes you feel whole and complete when you're with your partner. While it may seem like something only found in books or movies, many people experience this type of love throughout their lives. It's not limited to any specific age group; it can happen at any time. If you haven't experienced it yet, there's still a chance for you to find that special someone who will make you feel that way. Don't give up hope!

### Question:
i am a divorced woman with one child, and i'm in a relationship with a younger man. he has his own home, and i have mine. he stays at my house three nights a week and every other weekend, when my child is not with me. he eats and grooms himself in my home and swims in the community pool. he never offers to pay for anything, like food, movie tickets, etc. if we go out, he expects me to pay my own way. in today's world is there any responsibility on a man in a relationship to pay for anything other than himself? are the days of men taking women out and paying for the date gone? shouldn't he offer to bring groceries during the times he spends at my home? what should a lady expect from a man in a dating relationship? -- gal in virginia
### Answer:
In today's world, there is no strict rule that a man must pay for everything in a dating relationship. However, it is generally expected that both partners will contribute to the relationship in some way, whether through financial contributions or by taking on other responsibilities. It seems like your partner could be more considerate of your needs and offer to help out with expenses when he stays at your home. Open communication about expectations and financial responsibilities can help resolve this issue.
