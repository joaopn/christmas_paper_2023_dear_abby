### Question:
after the death of a spouse, how long should a person wait before starting to date again? -- dottie in michigan
### Answer:
There is no set time limit for when someone should start dating after the death of a spouse. It depends on the individual's emotional and mental state, as well as their personal circumstances. Some people may feel ready to date again within a few months, while others may need more time to grieve and heal before moving forward with new relationships. Ultimately, it is up to the individual to decide when they are emotionally and mentally ready to start dating again.

### Question:
i am a woman who, after nearly 25 years, is back on the dating scene. those years were spent in a same-sex relationship. i just happened to fall in love with a woman. i have custody of our child from the union. i do not put a label on my sexual orientation. i would like to meet a nice man and pursue a new relationship. how do i let interested parties know about my past? being back in the dating world is difficult enough without having to explain an unusual history. -- back in the game in arizona
### Answer:
You don't need to disclose your past relationship with another woman if you don't want to. However, it may be helpful for potential partners to know that you have experience dating women and understand their needs and desires. You can simply mention this in your profile or during conversations with interested parties. Alternatively, you could choose not to disclose anything about your past relationship until you feel comfortable doing so. Ultimately, the decision is up to you and what feels most authentic for you.

### Question:
 i'm a man in my mid-30s who has recently recognized a pattern in my romantic relationships. a few of them lasted for several years, before they ended for various reasons. in between, i've gone a couple of years before seeking out and starting a new relationship. in the in-between time, i go online and meet people i have no intention of meeting in "real life," but who provide conversation and intimacy while i enjoy single life. i'm about to repeat the pattern again. i'm a few months out of a three-year relationship and have met someone online. it's great to chat online and over the phone, but we are not close geographically, and i have no intention of meeting in person. what's your insight on this, and do you think this is healthy for me? any ideas you can offer regarding this pattern? -- new relationships
### Answer:
It sounds like you may be struggling with commitment issues or a fear of intimacy. It's important to address these underlying concerns in order to have successful and fulfilling relationships. Consider seeking therapy or counseling to work through these issues. Additionally, try setting boundaries around your online interactions to ensure that they remain platonic and don't become too emotionally intense.

### Question:
i'm 20 years old and have never dated anyone. i have a lot of friends and do well in school and at work, and i try to be a good, kind, friendly person. what can i do to make myself datable? am i missing some crucial step in how to become a girlfriend? -- old maid in st. louis
### Answer:
While it's great that you have friends and are doing well at school and work, being datable is not just about having those things. It also requires being open to new experiences, being vulnerable, and putting yourself out there. Here are some tips for making yourself more datable:
1. Work on your confidence: Confidence is attractive, so practice speaking up in social situations, take risks, and challenge yourself.
2. Be authentic: Don't try to be someone you're not - be true to who you are and what you believe in.
3. Practice active listening: Listen carefully to others and show that you value their opinions and experiences.
4. Show vulnerability: Being vulnerable can make you more relatable and attractive, so share your fears, insecurities, and hopes with someone you trust.
5. Be open-minded: Don't be afraid to try new things or meet new people - the more experiences you have, the better equipped you will be to find a partner who is right for you.

### Question:
it seems i will never meet my "mr. right." every person i'm attracted to is either in a relationship or doesn't like me. my questions are: (a) when is it ok to just "settle"? and (b) do you have to be attracted to your mr. right, and/or can you take the risk that the "supposed" sparkle/love will come in time? -- tired of dating, landover, md.
### Answer:
(a) It's never okay to settle for someone who doesn't make you happy or treat you well. If you feel like you're constantly settling and not meeting your needs, it may be time to reevaluate your dating habits and priorities.
(b) Attraction is important in a relationship, but it's not the only factor that determines whether two people will be compatible. You can take the risk of getting to know someone and seeing if the sparkle/love comes in time, as long as you're willing to put in the effort to make the relationship work. However, if you feel like you're constantly settling for less than what you want or deserve, it may be time to reevaluate your dating habits and priorities.

### Question:
my boyfriend, "clay," and i recently met another couple, "doreen" and "bob," who let us know they're interested in socializing together. i like the concept of double-dating. it has a different social dynamic than hanging out with clay's or my single friends. at first we enjoyed our time with them. we met twice for dinner that first month. however, lately we've been feeling pressured. doreen sends four or five e-mails during the week and then a few text messages asking about our plans and if we want to meet them on saturday. i have tried to explain that we can't afford to go out every weekend and that clay and i sometimes have other plans. i have told them i'd be willing to host a game night or rent a movie, but i get the impression they consider it an insult. the issue here is that we don't like being pushed. one text or e-mail toward the end of the week is plenty for us. but receiving several inquiries all week makes us feel trapped. we have our own projects, friends and activities. we can't spend every weekend with this couple. as much as we enjoy spending time with them, how can we politely let them know that it is becoming too much? -- in demand in annapolis
### Answer:
It sounds like you are feeling pressured by the other couple to spend more time together than you would like. It's important to communicate your boundaries and preferences clearly, so they understand what you can and cannot do. You could try sending a message back saying something like "We appreciate your interest in spending time with us, but we have our own plans and projects that we are working on. We would love to get together for game night or movie night sometime soon." This way, you're still being polite while also setting boundaries. If they continue to pressure you, it might be best to let them know that you don't feel comfortable with the level of contact and that you need some space.

### Question:
i am newly single after a 30-year marriage. would you please explain to me the protocol regarding intimacy? after how many dates is it appropriate to engage in intimacy? and afterward, should the man call the woman or the woman call the man? how long should one wait before calling? i'm afraid if i call too soon i'll appear needy, and if i wait too long to call i'll appear to be a player. -- tentative tom in tampa
### Answer:
Intimacy is a personal decision that should be based on mutual attraction and comfort level. There is no set number of dates before engaging in intimacy, as it depends on the individuals involved. As for calling afterward, it's generally considered polite to call within 24 hours if you had a good time and want to see the person again. However, if you feel like you need more time to process your feelings or don't want to seem too eager, waiting longer is perfectly acceptable.

### Question:
i do online dating. for safety, i use an alias. i look much younger than my 43 years, so i went out with a 29-year-old who thinks i'm 33. i have horrible luck with relationships and didn't think this one would be any different. boy, was i wrong! we have been dating three weeks now. how do i tell him i'm 43, have two kids he doesn't know about and a different name? or should i just break it off now? -- incognito in mississippi
### Answer:
It is important to be honest with your partner from the beginning. If you are not comfortable revealing your true age, identity, and family situation, then perhaps this relationship is not right for you. However, if you feel that you can trust him and believe he will accept you for who you are, then it may be worth disclosing this information to him. It is important to have an open and honest conversation about your past relationships and why you choose to use an alias online. This will help him understand your motivations and build a stronger foundation for the relationship moving forward.

### Question:
how do you attract single women while on a budget? -- gary in longwood, fla.
### Answer:
Greeting people with a smile and making eye contact can be effective ways to attract attention from single women without spending much money. Additionally, joining social groups or volunteering for causes that align with your interests can also help you meet like-minded individuals who may become potential romantic partners.

### Question:
how do you respond if you're dating a much older man and someone asks if he is your father? -- the younger woman in vero beach, fla.
### Answer:
I would suggest that she be honest with her partner about how she feels about his age difference and whether or not it bothers her. If she is comfortable with the relationship and does not mind the age gap, then there should be no need to address this question directly. However, if she is uncomfortable with the age difference, I would suggest that she have a conversation with her partner about how they can work together to make the relationship more equal and mutually satisfying.

### Question:
is there such a thing as "real love"? you know, the kind where you never feel complete unless your partner is there? i read books about this kind of love. i see movies about it and hear songs, but i have never experienced it. i am not a teen-ager, abby. i am 47 years old and wonder if i have missed out. -- wondering in iowa
### Answer:
While there is no one definition of "real love," many people believe that it involves a deep connection with another person that goes beyond physical attraction or emotional neediness. It can be a powerful force that brings two individuals together and helps them grow as individuals and as a couple. However, real love does not necessarily mean that you will never feel incomplete without your partner - everyone experiences moments of loneliness and longing at times. The key is to find ways to nurture your relationship and build a strong foundation of trust, communication, and mutual support.

### Question:
i am a divorced woman with one child, and i'm in a relationship with a younger man. he has his own home, and i have mine. he stays at my house three nights a week and every other weekend, when my child is not with me. he eats and grooms himself in my home and swims in the community pool. he never offers to pay for anything, like food, movie tickets, etc. if we go out, he expects me to pay my own way. in today's world is there any responsibility on a man in a relationship to pay for anything other than himself? are the days of men taking women out and paying for the date gone? shouldn't he offer to bring groceries during the times he spends at my home? what should a lady expect from a man in a dating relationship? -- gal in virginia
### Answer:
While there is no set rule on who pays for what in a relationship, it's generally expected that both parties contribute to shared expenses. If you are splitting the cost of groceries and other household items, then he should offer to bring them when he stays at your home. However, if you are paying for everything yourself, then he may not feel obligated to contribute financially. Ultimately, it's up to both parties to communicate their expectations and find a balance that works for them.
