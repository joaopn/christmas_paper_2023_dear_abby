### Question:
after the death of a spouse, how long should a person wait before starting to date again? -- dottie in michigan
### Answer:
  Dear Dottie,

There's no one-size-fits-all answer to this question, as everyone's grieving process and readiness for love again is unique. However, I would suggest that it's important to take the time to properly grieve and heal before jumping into a new relationship. This can help you avoid rebound relationships or ones that are not healthy for you.

It's also essential to focus on self-love and self-care during this period. Take time for yourself, engage in activities that bring you joy, and work on becoming the best version of yourself. When you're ready, you can re-enter the dating scene with a positive attitude, a healthy mindset, and an open heart.

Remember, love is worth the wait, and it's better to take your time than to rush into something that may not be right for you.

Wishing you all the best on your journey!

### Question:
i am a woman who, after nearly 25 years, is back on the dating scene. those years were spent in a same-sex relationship. i just happened to fall in love with a woman. i have custody of our child from the union. i do not put a label on my sexual orientation. i would like to meet a nice man and pursue a new relationship. how do i let interested parties know about my past? being back in the dating world is difficult enough without having to explain an unusual history. -- back in the game in arizona
### Answer:
  Welcome back to the dating scene! It's completely understandable to feel apprehensive about sharing your past, especially when it comes to non-traditional relationships. Here's my advice:

1. Be honest, but not necessarily upfront: You don't need to reveal everything on the first date or even the first few dates. As you get to know someone and build trust, you can gradually share more about your past.
2. Focus on the present: Instead of dwelling on your past, focus on the positives in your life now. Talk about your interests, hobbies, and goals. Showcase the amazing person you are today.
3. Use humor: If you're feeling comfortable, use humor to break the ice. You can say something like, "I have an interesting past, but let's just say I've been around the block a few times." This can help lighten the mood and make the conversation less intense.
4. Emphasize your child: If you're proud of being a mother, highlight that! Talk about your child's personality, interests, and how much joy they bring to your life. This will show potential partners that you're a caring and nurturing person.
5. Practice beforehand: Think about how you want to approach this topic with potential partners. Practice your responses so that you feel confident and comfortable discussing your past when the time comes.
6. Be open-minded: Remember that not everyone will be accepting or understanding of your past. That's okay! You deserve someone who loves and accepts you for who you are, regardless of your history. Keep searching until you find that person.

Remember, love conquers all, and there's someone out there who will embrace you and your unique journey. Good luck, and enjoy the adventure!

### Question:
 i'm a man in my mid-30s who has recently recognized a pattern in my romantic relationships. a few of them lasted for several years, before they ended for various reasons. in between, i've gone a couple of years before seeking out and starting a new relationship. in the in-between time, i go online and meet people i have no intention of meeting in "real life," but who provide conversation and intimacy while i enjoy single life. i'm about to repeat the pattern again. i'm a few months out of a three-year relationship and have met someone online. it's great to chat online and over the phone, but we are not close geographically, and i have no intention of meeting in person. what's your insight on this, and do you think this is healthy for me? any ideas you can offer regarding this pattern? -- new relationships
### Answer:
  It sounds like you're enjoying the convenience and comfort of online connections without the commitment or pressure of in-person relationships. While there's nothing inherently wrong with this, it's important to consider whether this pattern is truly fulfilling for you in the long run.

It's possible that you're avoiding the vulnerability and risk that comes with in-person relationships, or that you're not ready to commit to a new relationship yet. Reflecting on your motivations and feelings can help you understand your actions better.

Consider trying to meet some of your online connections in person. This can help you gauge whether there's a genuine connection worth pursuing or if it's merely a comfortable virtual friendship. You might also want to explore what you're looking for in a relationship and what qualities are important to you.

Ultimately, it's up to you to decide what works best for you. However, it's essential to be aware of your motivations and ensure that your actions align with your values and desires.

### Question:

### Answer:
  Hey there! I'm glad you're looking to expand your social horizons and find a special someone. The great news is that you're already on the right track by being a kind, friendly, and successful person. Here are some tips to help you become more datable:

1. Put yourself out there: Attend social events, join clubs or groups that align with your interests, and consider online dating. This will increase your chances of meeting potential partners.
2. Be open-minded: Don't limit yourself to a specific type or ideal. Be willing to give people a chance and get to know them for who they are.
3. Practice self-love: Work on building your confidence and self-esteem. When you feel good about yourself, you're more likely to attract someone who values and appreciates you.
4. Communicate effectively: Develop strong communication skills to foster healthy relationships. Listen actively, express yourself clearly, and be receptive to feedback.
5. Embrace your uniqueness: Celebrate what makes you different and special. Don't try to conform to societal standards or compare yourself to others.
6. Take time for self-reflection: Understand your values, goals, and aspirations. This will help you find someone who shares similar interests and values.
7. Be patient: Finding the right person takes time, so don't get discouraged if things don't happen immediately. Keep working on yourself and putting yourself out there.
8. Seek support: Surround yourself with positive influences, such as supportive friends and family. They can offer valuable advice, encouragement, and a fresh perspective.
9. Focus on shared experiences: Look for activities and interests that you both enjoy, as this can strengthen your bond and create lasting memories.
10. Practice gratitude: Appreciate the good things in life, no matter how small they may seem. This mindset will help you find joy in everyday moments and attract positive energy into your life.

Remember, becoming datable is not a one-size-fits-all solution. It's essential to focus on personal growth, self-love, and putting yourself out there. Believe in yourself, stay positive, and the right person will come along when the time is right. Good luck!

### Question:
it seems i will never meet my "mr. right." every person i'm attracted to is either in a relationship or doesn't like me. my questions are: (a) when is it ok to just "settle"? and (b) do you have to be attracted to your mr. right, and/or can you take the risk that the "supposed" sparkle/love will come in time? -- tired of dating, landover, md.
### Answer:
  Dear Tired of Dating,

I understand your frustration with the dating scene, but I would advise against settling for someone who doesn't excite you or make you happy. Attraction and chemistry are important aspects of a successful relationship, and it's possible to find someone who checks all the boxes and makes your heart skip a beat.

Instead of settling, consider taking a break from dating to focus on yourself and what brings you joy. Pursue hobbies, spend time with loved ones, and work on personal growth. This will not only make you a happier person but may also attract potential partners who share your interests and values.

Moreover, don't rely solely on physical attraction or a perceived "spark." Focus on building a connection based on shared experiences, values, and communication. With time and effort, a deep emotional bond can develop, leading to a fulfilling and satisfying relationship.

Remember, love is a journey, and it's okay to take your time and be patient. Believe in yourself, focus on the positives, and keep an open mind. The right person will come along when the time is right, and you'll know it when you feel that special connection.

### Question:
my boyfriend, "clay," and i recently met another couple, "doreen" and "bob," who let us know they're interested in socializing together. i like the concept of double-dating. it has a different social dynamic than hanging out with clay's or my single friends. at first we enjoyed our time with them. we met twice for dinner that first month. however, lately we've been feeling pressured. doreen sends four or five e-mails during the week and then a few text messages asking about our plans and if we want to meet them on saturday. i have tried to explain that we can't afford to go out every weekend and that clay and i sometimes have other plans. i have told them i'd be willing to host a game night or rent a movie, but i get the impression they consider it an insult. the issue here is that we don't like being pushed. one text or e-mail toward the end of the week is plenty for us. but receiving several inquiries all week makes us feel trapped. we have our own projects, friends and activities. we can't spend every weekend with this couple. as much as we enjoy spending time with them, how can we politely let them know that it is becoming too much? -- in demand in annapolis
### Answer:
  Hi there! I completely understand your concerns about feeling pressured by Doreen and Bob's frequent invitations. It's important to remember that communication is key in any relationship, especially when it comes to setting boundaries.

Here's a suggestion: why not try having an open and honest conversation with them? You could say something like, "Hey guys, we really enjoy spending time with you both, but we're feeling a bit overwhelmed with the frequency of your invitations. We have our own lives, interests, and commitments, and we'd love to have some space to breathe. Would it be okay if we scaled back our plans to once a month or every other month? That way, we can all have some time to ourselves and not feel so pressured."

By approaching the conversation in a respectful and considerate manner, you can express your needs without offending them. Remember, it's okay to prioritize your own needs and boundaries, especially when it comes to maintaining a healthy and balanced relationship. Good luck!

### Question:
i am newly single after a 30-year marriage. would you please explain to me the protocol regarding intimacy? after how many dates is it appropriate to engage in intimacy? and afterward, should the man call the woman or the woman call the man? how long should one wait before calling? i'm afraid if i call too soon i'll appear needy, and if i wait too long to call i'll appear to be a player. -- tentative tom in tampa
### Answer:
  Hi there, Tentative Tom! I understand your concerns about navigating the dating world after a long-term marriage. When it comes to intimacy, there's no one-size-fits-all answer, as everyone has different comfort levels and preferences. However, here are some general guidelines that may help:

1. Communicate openly: Before engaging in intimacy, make sure you and your partner have open and honest communication about your desires, boundaries, and expectations. This will help you both feel comfortable and avoid any misunderstandings.
2. Take things slowly: It's essential to take things slowly and get to know each other gradually. Don't rush into intimacy without building a solid foundation of trust, respect, and mutual understanding.
3. Focus on shared experiences: Instead of focusing solely on intimacy, try to focus on shared experiences and joyful moments together. This will help strengthen your bond and create a healthier relationship.
4. No strict timeline: There's no strict timeline for when to engage in intimacy or who should call whom. It's important to listen to your partner's needs and communicate openly about your own.
5. Be respectful: Remember that intimacy is a mutual experience, and both partners should be comfortable and willing. If you're unsure when to call or how long to wait, prioritize respecting your partner's boundaries and communicating openly.
6. Avoid labels: Try not to label yourself or your partner as "needy" or "a player." Focus on building a genuine connection, and don't worry too much about labels.

Remember, Tom, every relationship is unique, and what works for one couple may not work for another. Take things slowly, communicate openly, and prioritize mutual respect. Good luck!

### Answer:
  If someone asks if the older man you're dating is your father, you could respond with a lighthearted joke or a playful comeback that acknowledges the age difference without being too serious or defensive. Here are a few options:

* "No, he's not my father, but he's definitely got the wisdom and experience of one!"

* "He's not my dad, but he's definitely my favorite older man to spend time with!"
* "We've been getting that a lot lately! But no, we're just happy to be together and enjoying life."

Remember, the key is to keep it light and breezy, and not let other people's opinions or assumptions bring you down. Focus on the positives in your relationship and enjoy each other's company!

### Question:

### Answer:
  Hello Gal in Virginia! I understand your concerns about the financial aspects of your relationship. While it's true that traditional gender roles have evolved over time, it's still important for both partners to contribute to the relationship in meaningful ways.

In my opinion, it's not necessarily about who pays for what, but rather about showing appreciation and respect for each other's contributions. If you're feeling unvalued or taken advantage of, it's important to communicate your concerns with your partner.

I would suggest having an open and honest conversation with your boyfriend about how his behavior is making you feel. You deserve to be treated as an equal partner in the relationship, and it's important to establish mutual respect and understanding.

Remember, a healthy relationship is built on shared values, trust, and communication. Focus on building a strong connection with your partner, and the financial aspects will follow suit. Good luck!
