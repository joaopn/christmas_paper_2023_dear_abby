### Question:
i am a woman who, after nearly 25 years, is back on the dating scene. those years were spent in a same-sex relationship. i just happened to fall in love with a woman. i have custody of our child from the union. i do not put a label on my sexual orientation. i would like to meet a nice man and pursue a new relationship. how do i let interested parties know about my past? being back in the dating world is difficult enough without having to explain an unusual history. -- back in the game in arizona
### Answer:
You don't need to disclose your past relationship with another woman if you don't want to. You can simply focus on finding someone who accepts and appreciates you for who you are, regardless of your sexual orientation or previous relationships. If you feel comfortable sharing your story, you can do so gradually as the relationship progresses. However, it's ultimately up to you whether or not you choose to disclose this information.

### Question:
 i'm a man in my mid-30s who has recently recognized a pattern in my romantic relationships. a few of them lasted for several years, before they ended for various reasons. in between, i've gone a couple of years before seeking out and starting a new relationship. in the in-between time, i go online and meet people i have no intention of meeting in "real life," but who provide conversation and intimacy while i enjoy single life. i'm about to repeat the pattern again. i'm a few months out of a three-year relationship and have met someone online. it's great to chat online and over the phone, but we are not close geographically, and i have no intention of meeting in person. what's your insight on this, and do you think this is healthy for me? any ideas you can offer regarding this pattern? -- new relationships
### Answer:
It sounds like you are struggling with the idea of commitment and intimacy. It may be helpful to explore why you feel the need to seek out online relationships without meeting in person. Perhaps there is a fear of rejection or a lack of confidence in your ability to maintain a relationship. Consider seeking therapy or counseling to work through these issues. Additionally, try to focus on building meaningful connections with people who are close to you and prioritize spending time with them. This may help you develop the skills and confidence needed to form healthy relationships in the future.

### Answer:
You are already on the right track by being kind and friendly! To increase your dating potential, consider joining social activities or clubs that interest you. You can also try online dating apps or websites to meet new people. Remember, it's not about finding a perfect match but rather connecting with someone who shares similar interests and values.

### Question:
it seems i will never meet my "mr. right." every person i'm attracted to is either in a relationship or doesn't like me. my questions are: (a) when is it ok to just "settle"? and (b) do you have to be attracted to your mr. right, and/or can you take the risk that the "supposed" sparkle/love will come in time? -- tired of dating, landover, md.
### Answer:
(a) It's never okay to settle for someone who doesn't make you happy or fulfill your needs. If you feel like you're not being treated well or that the relationship is unhealthy in any way, it's important to end it and move on. (b) Attraction is a crucial component of a healthy relationship, but it doesn't necessarily have to be immediate. Love can grow over time with patience, understanding, and effort. However, if you don't feel that spark or connection initially, it may not be worth pursuing further.

### Question:
my boyfriend, "clay," and i recently met another couple, "doreen" and "bob," who let us know they're interested in socializing together. i like the concept of double-dating. it has a different social dynamic than hanging out with clay's or my single friends. at first we enjoyed our time with them. we met twice for dinner that first month. however, lately we've been feeling pressured. doreen sends four or five e-mails during the week and then a few text messages asking about our plans and if we want to meet them on saturday. i have tried to explain that we can't afford to go out every weekend and that clay and i sometimes have other plans. i have told them i'd be willing to host a game night or rent a movie, but i get the impression they consider it an insult. the issue here is that we don't like being pushed. one text or e-mail toward the end of the week is plenty for us. but receiving several inquiries all week makes us feel trapped. we have our own projects, friends and activities. we can't spend every weekend with this couple. as much as we enjoy spending time with them, how can we politely let them know that it is becoming too much? -- in demand in annapolis
### Answer:
It sounds like you are feeling pressured by the constant communication from Doreen and Bob. It's understandable to feel trapped when you don't have control over your own time. Here are some suggestions on how to politely let them know that it is becoming too much:
1. Send a polite response to their texts or emails, letting them know that you appreciate the invitation but can't make it this weekend. If they persist in asking about plans for the next weekend, simply say that you have other commitments and will let them know if your schedule changes.
2. Suggest a different activity that you would be willing to host or participate in. This could include a game night, movie night, or even a potluck dinner. By offering an alternative, you are showing that you are open to spending time with them but also respecting your own boundaries.
3. If they continue to pressure you for plans, it may be necessary to have a conversation with them about their communication style and how it makes you feel. Explain that while you enjoy spending time with them, you need some space to pursue your own interests and projects. Be honest and direct in your communication, but also remain respectful of their feelings.
Remember, relationships are a two-way street. While you may enjoy spending time with Doreen and Bob, it's important to prioritize your own needs as well. By setting boundaries and communicating effectively, you can create a healthy balance between socializing and pursuing your own interests.

### Question:
i am newly single after a 30-year marriage. would you please explain to me the protocol regarding intimacy? after how many dates is it appropriate to engage in intimacy? and afterward, should the man call the woman or the woman call the man? how long should one wait before calling? i'm afraid if i call too soon i'll appear needy, and if i wait too long to call i'll appear to be a player. -- tentative tom in tampa
### Answer:
Intimacy is a personal decision that should be based on mutual attraction and comfort level. There is no set number of dates before engaging in intimacy, as it depends on the individuals involved. As for calling afterward, it's generally considered polite to call within 24 hours if you had a good time and want to see the person again. However, if you feel like you need more time to process your feelings or don't want to seem too eager, waiting longer is perfectly fine.

### Question:
i do online dating. for safety, i use an alias. i look much younger than my 43 years, so i went out with a 29-year-old who thinks i'm 33. i have horrible luck with relationships and didn't think this one would be any different. boy, was i wrong! we have been dating three weeks now. how do i tell him i'm 43, have two kids he doesn't know about and a different name? or should i just break it off now? -- incognito in mississippi
### Answer:
It can be difficult to come clean about your age and past relationships, but it is important to be honest with your partner. If you feel like the relationship is moving too quickly for you to reveal this information, then breaking up now may be the best option. However, if you are still interested in pursuing a relationship with him, then you could try coming clean gradually over time. It might also help to explain why you chose to use an alias and how it has affected your past relationships. Ultimately, the decision is yours to make based on what feels right for you.

is there such a thing as "real love"? you know, the kind where you never feel complete unless your partner is there? i read books about this kind of love. i see movies about it and hear songs, but i have never experienced it. i am not a teen-ager, abby. i am 47 years old and wonder if i have missed out. -- wondering in iowa
### Answer:
Yes, there is such a thing as "real love." It's the kind of love that transcends physical attraction or material possessions. Real love is about finding someone who completes you, who makes you feel whole and happy, and who shares your values and goals in life. While it may be difficult to find this type of love, it is certainly possible with patience, openness, and a willingness to put in the effort.

### Question:
i am a divorced woman with one child, and i'm in a relationship with a younger man. he has his own home, and i have mine. he stays at my house three nights a week and every other weekend, when my child is not with me. he eats and grooms himself in my home and swims in the community pool. he never offers to pay for anything, like food, movie tickets, etc. if we go out, he expects me to pay my own way. in today's world is there any responsibility on a man in a relationship to pay for anything other than himself? are the days of men taking women out and paying for the date gone? shouldn't he offer to bring groceries during the times he spends at my home? what should a lady expect from a man in a dating relationship? -- gal in virginia
### Answer:
In today's world, there is no set rule for who pays for what in a relationship. It depends on the individual couple and their values and preferences. However, it is generally considered polite for the person initiating an activity to offer to pay for it. If your partner is staying at your home three nights a week and every other weekend, he should be contributing to household expenses such as groceries or utilities. It may also be appropriate for him to bring groceries during his time at your home if you are cooking together. Ultimately, the best way to navigate these issues is to communicate openly with your partner and establish clear expectations and boundaries.
