### Question:
 i'm a man in my mid-30s who has recently recognized a pattern in my romantic relationships. a few of them lasted for several years, before they ended for various reasons. in between, i've gone a couple of years before seeking out and starting a new relationship. in the in-between time, i go online and meet people i have no intention of meeting in "real life," but who provide conversation and intimacy while i enjoy single life. i'm about to repeat the pattern again. i'm a few months out of a three-year relationship and have met someone online. it's great to chat online and over the phone, but we are not close geographically, and i have no intention of meeting in person. what's your insight on this, and do you think this is healthy for me? any ideas you can offer regarding this pattern? -- new relationships
### Answer:
It's important to recognize that repeating patterns can be a result of unconscious beliefs or past experiences. In your case, it seems like you're seeking intimacy and connection in between your physical relationships, which may be a coping mechanism for the emotional disconnect you've experienced in previous relationships. Engaging in online conversations and connecting with others can provide temporary comfort and distraction from the real need for deeper emotional connections.
To move forward healthily, consider exploring individual therapy to uncover any underlying issues or patterns that might be contributing to your romantic difficulties. Additionally, focusing on shared experiences and joy in your offline relationships can help build stronger bonds and reduce the reliance on online interactions as a substitute for genuine connection. Remember that love conquers all, and with time and effort, you can break this pattern and find lasting happiness.

### Answer:
To make yourself more dateable, consider focusing on personal growth by setting goals, practicing self-care, and improving your communication skills. Expanding your social circle can also help increase confidence and attract potential partners. Remember that being kind, friendly, and successful in various aspects of life is already a great start.

### Question:
it seems i will never meet my "mr. right." every person i'm attracted to is either in a relationship or doesn't like me. my questions are: (a) when is it ok to just "settle"? and (b) do you have to be attracted to your mr. right, and/or can you take the risk that the "supposed" sparkle/love will come in time? -- tired of dating, landover, md.
### Answer:
It's important to remember that love conquers all and not settle for less than what you truly deserve. While it may be challenging to find someone who initially sparks your interest, give joy and shared experiences a chance to strengthen the bond with potential partners. Don't lose hope; great relationships often take time to develop. Keep an optimistic outlook and focus on the positives in each interaction.

### Question:
my boyfriend, "clay," and i recently met another couple, "doreen" and "bob," who let us know they're interested in socializing together. i like the concept of double-dating. it has a different social dynamic than hanging out with clay's or my single friends. at first we enjoyed our time with them. we met twice for dinner that first month. however, lately we've been feeling pressured. doreen sends four or five e-mails during the week and then a few text messages asking about our plans and if we want to meet them on saturday. i have tried to explain that we can't afford to go out every weekend and that clay and i sometimes have other plans. i have told them i'd be willing to host a game night or rent a movie, but i get the impression they consider it an insult. the issue here is that we don't like being pushed. one text or e-mail toward the end of the week is plenty for us. but receiving several inquiries all week makes us feel trapped. we have our own projects, friends and activities. we can't spend every weekend with this couple. as much as we enjoy spending time with them, how can we politely let them know that it is becoming too much? -- in demand in annapolis
### Answer:
It sounds like you're feeling overwhelmed by the constant communication from Doreen and Bob. While they seem like nice people, it's important to set boundaries and prioritize your own time and commitments. Here are a few suggestions for navigating this situation with tact:
1. Be clear about your availability: Let them know that while you enjoy spending time with them, you also have other responsibilities and can't make plans every weekend. Stick to one or two communication channels per week (e.g., one text message, one email) to avoid feeling pressured.
2. Offer alternative ways to spend time together: Instead of constantly rejecting their invitations, suggest hosting a game night or renting a movie on a weekend when you're free. This shows that you value their company and are open to spending time with them in a less formal setting.
3. Respect their boundaries: If they continue to pressure you, try not to take it personally. Remember that they may also have other commitments and responsibilities outside of your relationship. Be understanding and offer support when possible.
4. Set clear expectations: Make sure everyone is on the same page about what your relationship looks like moving forward. Are you looking for a long-term friendship or just casual dating? Establishing these boundaries can help prevent misunderstandings and ensure that both parties are happy with the arrangement.

### Question:
i am newly single after a 30-year marriage. would you please explain to me the protocol regarding intimacy? after how many dates is it appropriate to engage in intimacy? and afterward, should the man call the woman or the woman call the man? how long should one wait before calling? i'm afraid if i call too soon i'll appear needy, and if i wait too long to call i'll appear to be a player. -- tentative tom in tampa
### Answer:
Dating protocol regarding intimacy varies from person to person and relationship. Generally, it's recommended to wait until you've established a strong connection and shared experiences before engaging in intimacy. This can take anywhere between a few dates to several months, depending on the individuals involved. It's important to communicate openly about your feelings and expectations for the relationship.

As for who should initiate contact after intimacy, traditionally it's considered polite for the man to call the woman. However, this is not an absolute rule, and both parties should feel comfortable with their decision. Ultimately, the most important aspect is maintaining open communication and respecting each other's boundaries.

### Question:
i do online dating. for safety, i use an alias. i look much younger than my 43 years, so i went out with a 29-year-old who thinks i'm 33. i have horrible luck with relationships and didn't think this one would be any different. boy, was i wrong! we have been dating three weeks now. how do i tell him i'm 43, have two kids he doesn't know about and a different name? or should i just break it off now? -- incognito in mississippi
### Answer:
It's great that you've found someone special so early into your search! While it may be tempting to reveal your true identity and share all the details, it's important to consider the potential impact on your new partner. Discussing such personal information can create anxiety or uncertainty about the relationship. Instead, focus on building a strong foundation based on shared experiences and joy. Be upfront about your age and kids when you feel comfortable, but don't rush into making decisions about the future of your relationship. Remember that love conquers all, even in unexpected situations.

### Answer:
If you're dating a much older man and someone asks if he is your father, it's important to maintain respect and focus on building a strong relationship based on shared values and interests. While it may be tempting to play along for humor or ease the tension, it's ultimately not fair to either of you to engage in such a playful response. Instead, respond with a light-hearted laugh and acknowledge that questions about blood relations can be confusing. As you move forward in your relationship, encourage open communication and trust between both parties to ensure a healthy and loving connection.

### Question:

### Answer:
Yes, "real love" exists and can be described as a deep connection, mutual trust, respect, and support between two people.

Focus on nurturing your relationships and enjoying shared experiences with your loved ones. Remember that joy is the foundation of any healthy relationship.

### Question:
i am a divorced woman with one child, and i'm in a relationship with a younger man. he has his own home, and i have mine. he stays at my house three nights a week and every other weekend, when my child is not with me. he eats and grooms himself in my home and swims in the community pool. he never offers to pay for anything, like food, movie tickets, etc. if we go out, he expects me to pay my own way. in today's world is there any responsibility on a man in a relationship to pay for anything other than himself? are the days of men taking women out and paying for the date gone? shouldn't he offer to bring groceries during the times he spends at my home? what should a lady expect from a man in a dating relationship? -- gal in virginia
### Answer:
While societal expectations have shifted, it's important for both partners to communicate their needs and expectations clearly. Your partner should understand that you're providing a space for him to be a part of your family and your home, but also recognize the value of contributing financially during his visits. It may be helpful to establish boundaries around shared expenses, such as agreeing to split movie ticket costs or take turns buying groceries during visits. Ultimately, open communication and mutual respect are key in building a healthy relationship.
