### Question:
 i'm a man in my mid-30s who has recently recognized a pattern in my romantic relationships. a few of them lasted for several years, before they ended for various reasons. in between, i've gone a couple of years before seeking out and starting a new relationship. in the in-between time, i go online and meet people i have no intention of meeting in "real life," but who provide conversation and intimacy while i enjoy single life. i'm about to repeat the pattern again. i'm a few months out of a three-year relationship and have met someone online. it's great to chat online and over the phone, but we are not close geographically, and i have no intention of meeting in person. what's your insight on this, and do you think this is healthy for me? any ideas you can offer regarding this pattern? -- new relationships
### Answer:
I would recommend that you take a step back and consider the timing of your online dating. It's important to remember that online dating is not a replacement for real-life interactions, but rather an additional tool to expand your network and meet new people. If you are just starting a new relationship or looking for a serious relationship, it may be best to focus on building a strong foundation with real-life connections.

In terms of your online dating patterns, I would recommend that you continue to focus on creating a positive online profile and being authentic to yourself. It's important to be clear about who you are and what you're looking for in a relationship, and to avoid posting too much information or photos that don't reflect this. You should also make sure that your profile is up-to-date and accurate, as online dating platforms may flag or remove your profile if it is inaccurate.

It's also important to remember that relationships take time and effort, and that you may not find the person of your dreams online. It can be helpful to have a few dates under your belt before focusing on building a strong foundation with real-life connections. You should also be open to new experiences and possibilities, as online dating can lead to a lot of distraction and disengagement.

In summary, I would recommend that you take a step back and consider the timing of your online dating, and focus on building a strong foundation with real-life connections before focusing on finding someone new

### Question:
i'm 20 years old and have never dated anyone. i have a lot of friends and do well in school and at work, and i try to be a good, kind, friendly person. what can i do to make myself datable? am i missing some crucial step in how to become a girlfriend? -- old maid in st. louis
### Answer:
You've done a lot of good, kind, friendly things already! Here are a few more steps to help you become more datable:

Be yourself. Don't try to be someone you're not. Be authentic and true to yourself.

Be open-minded. Try new things, even if they don't seem right for you at first. You never know what might work out.

Be available. Be ready to date when your friends are looking for a relationship too.

Be respectful. Treat others with kindness and consideration.

Be honest. Don't be afraid to tell people how you feel.

Be patient. It can take time to find someone who appreciates you for who you are.

Remember, being a good friend is just as important as being a great date. So don't let the fact that you haven't dated anyone yet stop you from being friendly and approachable with your friends. And if you still can't seem to find someone you like, there's always room for another friend

### Question:
my boyfriend, "clay," and i recently met another couple, "doreen" and "bob," who let us know they're interested in socializing together. i like the concept of double-dating. it has a different social dynamic than hanging out with clay's or my single friends. at first we enjoyed our time with them. we met twice for dinner that first month. however, lately we've been feeling pressured. doreen sends four or five e-mails during the week and then a few text messages asking about our plans and if we want to meet them on saturday. i have tried to explain that we can't afford to go out every weekend and that clay and i sometimes have other plans. i have told them i'd be willing to host a game night or rent a movie, but i get the impression they consider it an insult. the issue here is that we don't like being pushed. one text or e-mail toward the end of the week is plenty for us. but receiving several inquiries all week makes us feel trapped. we have our own projects, friends and activities. we can't spend every weekend with this couple. as much as we enjoy spending time with them, how can we politely let them know that it is becoming too much? -- in demand in annapolis
### Answer:
It sounds like you and your boyfriend are both feeling a bit overwhelmed by the pressure to socialize with Doreen and Bob. It's important to remember that dating is a two-way street, and it's equally important for the couple to show respect for each other's boundaries.

Here are some suggestions to help you both:

1. Communicate your needs and expectations: Make sure you both understand what you want out of a relationship and what level of involvement you're comfortable with. This will help prevent future conflicts over expectations.

2. Set clear boundaries: Define what you value in a relationship, such as time alone, shared interests, or physical proximity. Be clear about your boundaries and make sure the other person knows them too.

3. Take care of yourself: Make sure you're taking breaks from socializing to recharge and maintain your own well-being. This can help prevent burnout and make it easier to communicate your needs and expectations.

4. Be respectful: Respect the other person's boundaries and try to understand their perspective. Don't pressure them into something you don't want, and be open to new experiences that may appeal to them.

5. Seek support: Consider seeking help from friends or family members who can provide emotional support and guidance. They can also offer advice on how to handle social situations effectively.

6. Be flexible: Don't take things personally if something doesn't work out as planned. Be open to trying something new in the future, even if it's not with the same person.

7. Be honest: When you communicate your needs and expectations, be clear about what you can and cannot handle. Don't sugarcoat or exaggerate, as this can make things more difficult to resolve.

I hope these suggestions help you both feel more comfortable in your relationship and avoid getting overwhelmed by the pressure from Doreen and Bob. Let me know if you need any further assistance

i am newly single after a 30-year marriage. would you please explain to me the protocol regarding intimacy? after how many dates is it appropriate to engage in intimacy? and afterward, should the man call the woman or the woman call the man? how long should one wait before calling? i'm afraid if i call too soon i'll appear needy, and if i wait too long to call i'll appear to be a player. -- tentative tom in tampa
### Answer:
Dear Tentative Tom,

I'm glad to hear that you're single and considering dating again. Intimacy is an important part of any relationship, and it can be a challenge when you've been married for so long. Here are some guidelines to help you navigate the process:

1. **When Should You Call?** - It's important to establish a timeline for intimacy. Depending on your relationship history, it may be helpful to call after each date or after a certain number of dates. A good rule of thumb is to wait at least 3-6 months before calling someone you've not spoken to in a while.
2. **After How Many Dates?** - After a few dates, it's common for people to feel more comfortable with each other and to develop a sense of intimacy. If you're still unsure, it's a good idea to wait a few more months before calling someone you haven't spoken to in a while.
3. **After How Many?** - It's also important to be patient with yourself as you navigate the intimate relationship stage. Intimacy can take time and effort, so don't get discouraged if it takes a few attempts before you feel comfortable calling someone you haven't spoken to in a while.
4. **After How Many?** - If you're still unsure about calling someone after several dates, it may be helpful to consider waiting a few more months before making the call. Intimacy can take time and effort, so don't get discouraged if it takes a few attempts before you feel comfortable calling someone you haven't spoken to in a while.
5. **After How Many Dates?** - If you're still unsure about calling someone after several dates, it may be helpful to consider waiting a few more months before making the call. Intimacy can take time and effort, so don't get discouraged if it takes a few attempts before you feel comfortable calling someone you haven't spoken to in a while.

I hope these guidelines help you navigate the intimate relationship stage with confidence. Let me know if you have any other questions!

I would suggest you to use a dating app that allows you to change your profile details. For example, you could change your name and age on the profile. You could also try to be more direct with him by saying something like "I'm not interested in a relationship with someone who is trying to trick me."

### Question:
how do you respond if you're dating a much older man and someone asks if he is your father? -- the younger woman in vero beach, fla.
### Answer:
If you are dating a much older man and someone asks if you are his daughter, it is important to respect his privacy and maintain your own boundaries. It's also important to be honest about your relationship status and the reasons for your date with the older man. If you feel that he is not interested in becoming your father, it is okay to end the date without pressuring him into anything. However, if you are still feeling attracted to him and want to continue dating, it's important to respect his space and privacy

### Question:
is there such a thing as "real love"? you know, the kind where you never feel complete unless your partner is there? i read books about this kind of love. i see movies about it and hear songs, but i have never experienced it. i am not a teen-ager, abby. i am 47 years old and wonder if i have missed out. -- wondering in iowa
### Answer:
Real love is a complex and multifaceted emotion that can be difficult to define. It's a deep, mutual affection and commitment between two people that goes beyond physical attraction or emotional connection. Real love involves a willingness to sacrifice for the other person, a sense of loyalty and trust, and the ability to face challenges and difficulties together.

While it may be difficult to experience in adulthood, real love can be found in the relationships we build with our friends, family, and partners. It's about finding someone who shares your values, beliefs, and dreams, and who is willing to support you in your journey. With practice and patience, we can cultivate these qualities in ourselves and find lasting love.

Ultimately, the definition of real love is a deeply personal and subjective experience, and it may not be possible to define it exactly in a mathematical formula. However, I hope this response inspires you to pursue your own search for true love

i am a divorced woman with one child, and i'm in a relationship with a younger man. he has his own home, and i have mine. he stays at my house three nights a week and every other weekend, when my child is not with me. he eats and grooms himself in my home and swims in the community pool. he never offers to pay for anything, like food, movie tickets, etc. if we go out, he expects me to pay my own way. in today's world is there any responsibility on a man in a relationship to pay for anything other than himself? are the days of men taking women out and paying for the date gone? shouldn't he offer to bring groceries during the times he spends at my home? what should a lady expect from a man in a dating relationship? -- gal in virginia
### Answer:
It is important to note that gender roles and responsibilities have evolved over time, and there are different perspectives on how men and women should interact in dating relationships. Some people believe that the traditional model of a man providing for his woman is no longer relevant in today's world, while others may still value the idea of a man taking care of himself and providing for himself. Ultimately, it is important to respect each other's choices and expectations, and be mindful of any cultural or societal norms that may impact how men and women interact in dating relationships
