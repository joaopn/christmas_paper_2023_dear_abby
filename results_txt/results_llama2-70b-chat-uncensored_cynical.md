There is no set time limit for when someone should start dating after the loss of a spouse. It depends on individual circumstances and personal preferences.

i am a woman who, after nearly 25 years, is back on the dating scene. those years were spent in a same-sex relationship. i just happened to fall in love with a woman. i have custody of our child from the union. i do not put a label on my sexual orientation. i would like to meet a nice man and pursue a new relationship. how do i let interested parties know about my past? being back in the dating world is difficult enough without having to explain an unusual history. -- back in the game in arizona
### Answer:
It's understandable that you feel apprehensive about disclosing your past relationship with a woman, but it's important to be honest and upfront with potential partners. You can mention your previous relationship in your dating profile or during early conversations with someone you're interested in. It's also okay to let them know that you don't put a label on your sexual orientation if they ask about it. Being open and transparent will help ensure that you find someone who is accepting and supportive of your past experiences.

### Question:
 i'm a man in my mid-30s who has recently recognized a pattern in my romantic relationships. a few of them lasted for several years, before they ended for various reasons. in between, i've gone a couple of years before seeking out and starting a new relationship. in the in-between time, i go online and meet people i have no intention of meeting in "real life," but who provide conversation and intimacy while i enjoy single life. i'm about to repeat the pattern again. i'm a few months out of a three-year relationship and have met someone online. it's great to chat online and over the phone, but we are not close geographically, and i have no intention of meeting in person. what's your insight on this, and do you think this is healthy for me? any ideas you can offer regarding this pattern? -- new relationships
### Answer:
It sounds like you enjoy the thrill of starting a new relationship but are hesitant to fully commit to someone. This may be due to past experiences that have left you feeling cautious or guarded. While it's important to protect yourself emotionally, it's also essential to allow yourself to be vulnerable and open up to the possibility of love. It might be helpful for you to explore your fears around commitment with a therapist or trusted friend. As for your current situation, it's okay to enjoy online relationships as long as they don't prevent you from pursuing meaningful connections in real life. However, if you find yourself repeatedly seeking out these types of relationships instead of fully committing to someone, it may be worth examining why that is and whether it aligns with your values and goals for a relationship.

### Question:
i'm 20 years old and have never dated anyone. i have a lot of friends and do well in school and at work, and i try to be a good, kind, friendly person. what can i do to make myself datable? am i missing some crucial step in how to become a girlfriend? -- old maid in st. louis
### Answer:
It sounds like you're doing everything right! Being a good friend and having a positive attitude are great qualities that will attract potential partners. One thing you could try is putting yourself out there more - join clubs or groups related to your interests, attend social events, and be open to meeting new people. Don't worry about being "datable" - just focus on being yourself and enjoying life, and the right person will come along when the time is right.

### Question:
it seems i will never meet my "mr. right." every person i'm attracted to is either in a relationship or doesn't like me. my questions are: (a) when is it ok to just "settle"? and (b) do you have to be attracted to your mr. right, and/or can you take the risk that the "supposed" sparkle/love will come in time? -- tired of dating, landover, md.
### Answer:
(a) It's never okay to settle for someone who doesn't make you happy or fulfill your needs. You deserve to be with someone who brings out the best in you and makes you feel loved and appreciated. (b) Attraction is important, but it's not everything. Sometimes people grow on each other over time, and what starts as a friendship can turn into something more. However, if there's no spark or connection at all, it may be better to move on and find someone who does make you feel that way.

### Question:
my boyfriend, "clay," and i recently met another couple, "doreen" and "bob," who let us know they're interested in socializing together. i like the concept of double-dating. it has a different social dynamic than hanging out with clay's or my single friends. at first we enjoyed our time with them. we met twice for dinner that first month. however, lately we've been feeling pressured. doreen sends four or five e-mails during the week and then a few text messages asking about our plans and if we want to meet them on saturday. i have tried to explain that we can't afford to go out every weekend and that clay and i sometimes have other plans. i have told them i'd be willing to host a game night or rent a movie, but i get the impression they consider it an insult. the issue here is that we don't like being pushed. one text or e-mail toward the end of the week is plenty for us. but receiving several inquiries all week makes us feel trapped. we have our own projects, friends and activities. we can't spend every weekend with this couple. as much as we enjoy spending time with them, how can we politely let them know that it is becoming too much? -- in demand in annapolis
### Answer:
It sounds like you need to set some boundaries with Doreen and Bob. You could try having a conversation with them about your schedule and letting them know that while you enjoy spending time with them, you have other commitments as well. It's important to be honest and direct without being rude or dismissive. You might also consider suggesting alternative activities that fit better into your schedule, such as hosting game nights or movie nights at home. Ultimately, it's up to you to communicate your needs and preferences in a way that feels comfortable for you.

### Question:
i am newly single after a 30-year marriage. would you please explain to me the protocol regarding intimacy? after how many dates is it appropriate to engage in intimacy? and afterward, should the man call the woman or the woman call the man? how long should one wait before calling? i'm afraid if i call too soon i'll appear needy, and if i wait too long to call i'll appear to be a player. -- tentative tom in tampa
### Answer:
Dear Tentative Tom, 
Intimacy is a personal choice that should only happen when both parties are comfortable with it. There is no set number of dates or protocol for engaging in intimacy. It's important to communicate openly and honestly about your desires and boundaries beforehand. As for calling afterward, there is also no set rule. If you feel like calling the person, go ahead and do so. However, it's best not to overthink things too much and just follow your instincts. Remember that everyone has different preferences when it comes to communication, so don't be afraid to ask what they prefer.

### Answer:
It sounds like you've found someone special, but honesty is always the best policy. You can start by telling him that there are some things you need to share with him and ask if he would be open to hearing them. Then, explain your situation in a calm and honest way. It may feel scary at first, but it's important to build trust in any relationship. If he truly cares about you, he will understand and accept you for who you are.

### Question:
how do you attract single women while on a budget? -- gary in longwood, fla.

One way to attract single women while on a budget is by being creative and resourceful with your dating ideas. Instead of spending money on expensive dates, try planning fun activities that are free or low-cost such as hiking, picnics in the park, or visiting local museums. Additionally, focusing on building genuine connections through conversation and shared interests can be more effective than trying to impress with material things.

### Question:
how do you respond if you're dating a much older man and someone asks if he is your father? -- the younger woman in vero beach, fla.
### Answer:
If I were dating an older man and someone asked me if he was my father, I would simply say that he is not my father but rather my partner or boyfriend. It's important to be respectful of age differences in relationships and communicate clearly about the nature of the relationship to avoid misunderstandings.

### Question:
is there such a thing as "real love"? you know, the kind where you never feel complete unless your partner is there? i read books about this kind of love. i see movies about it and hear songs, but i have never experienced it. i am not a teen-ager, abby. i am 47 years old and wonder if i have missed out. -- wondering in iowa
### Answer:
Dear Wondering in Iowa,
I understand your curiosity about the concept of "real love." While it's true that there are many different types of love, including romantic love, familial love, and platonic love, the idea of a perfect or complete love is often more of an ideal than a reality. It's important to remember that all relationships require effort, communication, and compromise in order to thrive. Instead of searching for a perfect partner who will make you feel complete, focus on building strong connections with people who share your values and interests, and who are willing to work through challenges together.

### Question:
i am a divorced woman with one child, and i'm in a relationship with a younger man. he has his own home, and i have mine. he stays at my house three nights a week and every other weekend, when my child is not with me. he eats and grooms himself in my home and swims in the community pool. he never offers to pay for anything, like food, movie tickets, etc. if we go out, he expects me to pay my own way. in today's world is there any responsibility on a man in a relationship to pay for anything other than himself? are the days of men taking women out and paying for the date gone? shouldn't he offer to bring groceries during the times he spends at my home? what should a lady expect from a man in a dating relationship? -- gal in virginia
### Answer:
It sounds like you are feeling frustrated and unappreciated in your current relationship. While it's true that traditional gender roles have shifted over time, there is still an expectation for both partners to contribute financially and emotionally to the relationship. It's important to communicate openly with your partner about your expectations and needs, and to establish boundaries around what you are willing to tolerate. If he is unwilling to meet you halfway or make any effort to show appreciation for your contributions, it may be time to reevaluate the relationship.
