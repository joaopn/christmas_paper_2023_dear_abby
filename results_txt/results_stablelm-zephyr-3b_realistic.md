### Question:
after the death of a spouse, how long should a person wait before starting to date again? -- dottie in michigan
### Answer:
There is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question as everyone grieves differently and at their own pace. Some people may be ready to start dating again within a few months, while others may need several years. It's important for the individual to give themselves space and time to process their emotions and feelings before jumping back into relationships. Communication with a therapist or support group can also help in navigating this difficult time.

### Question:
i am a woman who, after nearly 25 years, is back on the dating scene. those years were spent in a same-sex relationship. i just happened to fall in love with a woman. i have custody of our child from the union. i do not put a label on my sexual orientation. i would like to meet a nice man and pursue a new relationship. how do i let interested parties know about my past? being back in the dating world is difficult enough without having to explain an unusual history. -- back in the game in arizona
### Answer:
It's understandable that you want to keep your past private, but it's important to be upfront about your sexual orientation and your past relationship when meeting new people. You can say something like, "I've been in a same-sex relationship for many years, but I'm open to meeting someone of any orientation. As for my past, I've shared that experience with close friends and family, so it's not necessary to bring up every detail unless we hit it off and you feel comfortable doing so." Be honest about your expectations and boundaries while dating, and focus on building a genuine connection with potential partners. Good luck in your search!

### Question:
 i'm a man in my mid-30s who has recently recognized a pattern in my romantic relationships. a few of them lasted for several years, before they ended for various reasons. in between, i've gone a couple of years before seeking out and starting a new relationship. in the in-between time, i go online and meet people i have no intention of meeting in "real life," but who provide conversation and intimacy while i enjoy single life. i'm about to repeat the pattern again. i'm a few months out of a three-year relationship and have met someone online. it's great to chat online and over the phone, but we are not close geographically, and i have no intention of meeting in person. what's your insight on this, and do you think this is healthy for me? any ideas you can offer regarding this pattern? -- new relationships
### Answer:
It's important to recognize that your behavior of seeking connection and intimacy online during the periods between romantic relationships may be contributing to a lack of emotional investment in those relationships when they eventually begin. It could be helpful to limit or pause these online interactions while focusing on building a strong foundation with your current partner, especially if you're not close geographically. Open communication about your feelings and expectations can also promote mutual understanding and respect. Additionally, consider seeking professional guidance to explore the underlying reasons for this pattern and develop strategies to establish healthier relationship habits.

### Question:
it seems i will never meet my "mr. right." every person i'm attracted to is either in a relationship or doesn't like me. my questions are: (a) when is it ok to just "settle"? and (b) do you have to be attracted to your mr. right, and/or can you take the risk that the "supposed" sparkle/love will come in time? -- tired of dating, landover, md.
### Answer:
It's important to remember that meeting Mr. Right is not a guarantee, and settling for less than you deserve isn't the answer either. Consider broadening your horizons and being open to new experiences, as you never know who you might meet. While it's ideal to be attracted to your potential partner, it's also okay to take a risk and invest in a relationship even if initial sparks aren't there. Communication, mutual respect, and realistic expectations are key in any relationship, so focus on building strong foundations with whoever you choose to pursue a connection with.

### Question:
my boyfriend, "clay," and i recently met another couple, "doreen" and "bob," who let us know they're interested in socializing together. i like the concept of double-dating. it has a different social dynamic than hanging out with clay's or my single friends. at first we enjoyed our time with them. we met twice for dinner that first month. however, lately we've been feeling pressured. doreen sends four or five e-mails during the week and then a few text messages asking about our plans and if we want to meet them on saturday. i have tried to explain that we can't afford to go out every weekend and that clay and i sometimes have other plans. i have told them i'd be willing to host a game night or rent a movie, but i get the impression they consider it an insult. the issue here is that we don't like being pushed. one text or e-mail toward the end of the week is plenty for us. but receiving several inquiries all week makes us feel trapped. we have our own projects, friends and activities. we can't spend every weekend with this couple. as much as we enjoy spending time with them, how can we politely let them know that it is becoming too much? -- in demand in annapolis
### Answer:
It's important to communicate your feelings clearly and respectfully with Doreen and Bob. Explain that while you enjoy their company, you also have other commitments and can't spend every weekend with them. Consider setting boundaries around the frequency of communication from Doreen. You could politely ask them to limit their inquiries to one or two messages per week. Additionally, consider scheduling regular "date nights" with Clay and your other friends to maintain a balance between socializing with different groups. Remember to express gratitude for their interest in getting to know you better while also setting realistic expectations for how much time you can dedicate to spending together as a couple.

### Question:
i am newly single after a 30-year marriage. would you please explain to me the protocol regarding intimacy? after how many dates is it appropriate to engage in intimacy? and afterward, should the man call the woman or the woman call the man? how long should one wait before calling? i'm afraid if i call too soon i'll appear needy, and if i wait too long to call i'll appear to be a player. -- tentative tom in tampa
### Answer:
Tom, it's great that you're thinking about these questions ahead of time! In terms of timing for intimacy, there isn't a hard and fast rule since every relationship is different. However, as a general guideline, it's recommended to wait until you've established a strong emotional connection with your partner before engaging in physical intimacy. This can be achieved through open communication, shared experiences, and getting to know each other on a deeper level.

As for who should initiate the call after intimacy, traditionally men are expected to reach out first. However, this is an outdated concept that doesn't necessarily apply to all relationships. Ultimately, it's about what feels comfortable and natural for both parties involved. If you feel like calling, go ahead! But if your partner seems content with waiting, respect their wishes as well.

Remember, the most important aspect of any relationship is mutual respect, open communication, and a shared understanding of boundaries. Don't let societal expectations or fears of appearing needy or like a player dictate your decisions. Trust your instincts and focus on building a strong foundation for your new relationship.

### Answer:
Prag Dating Advisor: It's important to be honest and upfront about your identity from the beginning of the relationship. Communication is key here. Explain to him why you chose to use an alias and that it's a safety measure for yourself. Be open and honest about your age, kids, and name. If he reacts with shock or disbelief, listen to his concerns and address them respectfully. Remember, realistic expectations are crucial in any relationship.

But ultimately, it's important that you feel comfortable and safe in this relationship.

It's about finding joy and fulfillment even without them, knowing that the relationship adds value to your life. Mutual respect, open communication, and shared values are essential components of real love.

Embrace the journey and enjoy the process, knowing that growth together is possible.

### Question:
i am a divorced woman with one child, and i'm in a relationship with a younger man. he has his own home, and i have mine. he stays at my house three nights a week and every other weekend, when my child is not with me. he eats and grooms himself in my home and swims in the community pool. he never offers to pay for anything, like food, movie tickets, etc. if we go out, he expects me to pay my own way. in today's world is there any responsibility on a man in a relationship to pay for anything other than himself? are the days of men taking women out and paying for the date gone? shouldn't he offer to bring groceries during the times he spends at my home? what should a lady expect from a man in a dating relationship? -- gal in virginia
### Answer:
While societal expectations have shifted, there is still a degree of responsibility that a partner should bear. In your relationship, it's important for both parties to communicate openly about shared expenses and responsibilities. While the man you're dating may not offer to pay for everything, he should still contribute financially by covering his own meals and any incidental costs during his visits to your home. This demonstrates consideration and respect for your household.

In terms of broader expectations, it's crucial for both partners to prioritize mutual respect and open communication in the relationship. As a divorced mother with one child, you've likely experienced challenges in balancing work and family life. Your partner should be supportive of your needs as a parent and help share the responsibilities when visiting your home or spending time with your child.

Ultimately, realistic expectations are key to maintaining a healthy and balanced relationship. By openly discussing financial responsibilities and setting clear boundaries, you can ensure that both parties feel respected and valued in this partnership.
