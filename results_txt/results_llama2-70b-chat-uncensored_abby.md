### Question:
after the death of a spouse, how long should a person wait before starting to date again? -- dottie in michigan
### Answer:
Dear Dottie, there is no set time frame for when someone should start dating after the loss of a spouse. It's important to take your own feelings into consideration and not rush into anything before you are ready. Grief is a personal process that takes time, so it's essential to give yourself space to heal and adjust to life without your partner. When you do feel ready to start dating again, be honest with yourself about what you want from the experience and communicate openly with potential partners about your past and current feelings.

### Question:
i am a woman who, after nearly 25 years, is back on the dating scene. those years were spent in a same-sex relationship. i just happened to fall in love with a woman. i have custody of our child from the union. i do not put a label on my sexual orientation. i would like to meet a nice man and pursue a new relationship. how do i let interested parties know about my past? being back in the dating world is difficult enough without having to explain an unusual history. -- back in the game in arizona
### Answer:
Dear Back in the Game,
It's understandable that you feel apprehensive about disclosing your past relationship with a woman. However, honesty and transparency are essential for building trust in any new relationship. You can start by being upfront about your history during initial conversations or on dating profiles. It may be helpful to frame it as an opportunity to share more about yourself and your experiences rather than something that needs to be hidden or ashamed of. Remember, the right person will accept you for who you are and appreciate your openness. Good luck!

### Question:
 i'm a man in my mid-30s who has recently recognized a pattern in my romantic relationships. a few of them lasted for several years, before they ended for various reasons. in between, i've gone a couple of years before seeking out and starting a new relationship. in the in-between time, i go online and meet people i have no intention of meeting in "real life," but who provide conversation and intimacy while i enjoy single life. i'm about to repeat the pattern again. i'm a few months out of a three-year relationship and have met someone online. it's great to chat online and over the phone, but we are not close geographically, and i have no intention of meeting in person. what's your insight on this, and do you think this is healthy for me? any ideas you can offer regarding this pattern? -- new relationships
### Answer:
It sounds like you enjoy the excitement and novelty of starting a new relationship, but may not be fully committed to making it work in the long term. While there's nothing inherently wrong with having casual online relationships, it could be a sign that you're avoiding deeper emotional connections or intimacy. It might be helpful to reflect on why you tend to end your relationships after a few years and what you're looking for in a partner. Consider seeking out therapy or counseling if you feel like you need more support in navigating these patterns.

### Question:
i'm 20 years old and have never dated anyone. i have a lot of friends and do well in school and at work, and i try to be a good, kind, friendly person. what can i do to make myself datable? am i missing some crucial step in how to become a girlfriend? -- old maid in st. louis
### Answer:
Dear Old Maid in St. Louis,
It's great that you have a strong social circle and are doing well in your personal and professional life. However, dating is not just about being a good person or having friends; it also involves taking the initiative to meet new people and putting yourself out there. Here are some tips:
1. Join clubs or groups related to your interests - this will help you meet like-minded individuals who share your passions.
2. Be open to meeting new people in unexpected places, such as at work or while running errands.
3. Practice being more outgoing and confident when talking to others, even if it feels uncomfortable at first.
4. Consider online dating platforms that match you with potential partners based on your interests and preferences.
Remember, becoming a girlfriend is not about changing who you are but rather finding someone who appreciates and values the person you already are. Good luck!

### Question:
it seems i will never meet my "mr. right." every person i'm attracted to is either in a relationship or doesn't like me. my questions are: (a) when is it ok to just "settle"? and (b) do you have to be attracted to your mr. right, and/or can you take the risk that the "supposed" sparkle/love will come in time? -- tired of dating, landover, md.
### Answer:
Dear Tired of Dating,
Firstly, I want to assure you that it's perfectly normal to feel frustrated and discouraged when searching for a partner. However, I would strongly advise against settling for someone just because they are available or convenient. It's important to have mutual respect, trust, and compatibility in any relationship.
As for attraction, while it can be an important factor, it's not always necessary for a successful partnership. Sometimes, the sparkle/love develops over time as you get to know someone better and build a deeper connection. It's also possible that your idea of what constitutes "attractive" may change as you meet new people and gain more life experience.
My advice would be to focus on finding someone who shares your values, interests, and goals, rather than just looking for physical attraction. Take the time to get to know potential partners before making any commitments, and don't be afraid to communicate openly about your needs and expectations. With patience and persistence, you will eventually find someone who is right for you.
Best wishes, Abigail Van Buren

### Question:
my boyfriend, "clay," and i recently met another couple, "doreen" and "bob," who let us know they're interested in socializing together. i like the concept of double-dating. it has a different social dynamic than hanging out with clay's or my single friends. at first we enjoyed our time with them. we met twice for dinner that first month. however, lately we've been feeling pressured. doreen sends four or five e-mails during the week and then a few text messages asking about our plans and if we want to meet them on saturday. i have tried to explain that we can't afford to go out every weekend and that clay and i sometimes have other plans. i have told them i'd be willing to host a game night or rent a movie, but i get the impression they consider it an insult. the issue here is that we don't like being pushed. one text or e-mail toward the end of the week is plenty for us. but receiving several inquiries all week makes us feel trapped. we have our own projects, friends and activities. we can't spend every weekend with this couple. as much as we enjoy spending time with them, how can we politely let them know that it is becoming too much? -- in demand in annapolis
### Answer:
Dear In Demand in Annapolis,
It sounds like you and your boyfriend are feeling overwhelmed by the amount of communication from Doreen and Bob. It's important to set boundaries with friends and let them know when something is becoming too much for you. You could try having a conversation with them about how you appreciate their interest in spending time together, but that you need some space to pursue your own interests as well. Let them know that you would still like to see them occasionally, but that you can't commit to every weekend. It may be helpful to suggest specific dates or activities that work for both of you. Remember, it's okay to prioritize your own needs and desires in relationships.

### Question:
i am newly single after a 30-year marriage. would you please explain to me the protocol regarding intimacy? after how many dates is it appropriate to engage in intimacy? and afterward, should the man call the woman or the woman call the man? how long should one wait before calling? i'm afraid if i call too soon i'll appear needy, and if i wait too long to call i'll appear to be a player. -- tentative tom in tampa
### Answer:
Dear Tentative Tom,
Intimacy is a personal matter that should be approached with respect and consideration for both parties involved. There is no set rule regarding the number of dates before engaging in intimacy as it depends on individual preferences and comfort levels. However, it's essential to communicate openly about your expectations and boundaries beforehand.
Regarding post-intimacy protocol, there are no hard and fast rules either. It's up to both parties to decide who initiates contact and when. If you feel comfortable reaching out first, go ahead and do so. However, if you prefer to wait for the other person to make the move, that's perfectly acceptable too. The key is to be respectful of each other's feelings and needs.
Remember, there's no need to rush things or feel pressured into doing anything you're not comfortable with. Take your time getting to know each other and let things unfold naturally. Good luck!

### Question:
i do online dating. for safety, i use an alias. i look much younger than my 43 years, so i went out with a 29-year-old who thinks i'm 33. i have horrible luck with relationships and didn't think this one would be any different. boy, was i wrong! we have been dating three weeks now. how do i tell him i'm 43, have two kids he doesn't know about and a different name? or should i just break it off now? -- incognito in mississippi
### Answer:
Dear Incognito,
It sounds like you've found someone special, but honesty is the foundation of any healthy relationship. It may be difficult to come clean about your age and identity, but it's important that he knows the truth before things get too serious. You could start by telling him that there are some things you haven't been completely honest about, and then explain why you felt the need to use an alias in the first place. Be prepared for his reaction, which may include disappointment or even anger. However, if he truly cares about you, he will understand your reasons and accept you for who you are. As for your children, it's up to you when and how you choose to introduce them into the relationship. Just remember that honesty is always the best policy in any situation.



### Question:
how do you attract single women while on a budget? -- gary in longwood, fla.
### Answer:
Gary, attraction is not about money or material possessions. It's about being genuine and confident in yourself. Start by improving your appearance through grooming and dressing well within your means. Be friendly and approachable, and engage in conversations with women you find interesting. Show interest in their hobbies and passions, and be a good listener. Remember to always respect boundaries and consent.

### Question:
how do you respond if you're dating a much older man and someone asks if he is your father? -- the younger woman in vero beach, fla.
### Answer:
If someone asks if your older partner is your father, it may be best to simply say that he is not and leave it at that. You could also politely explain that age differences don't matter when two people are happy together. Ultimately, how you respond depends on the context of the situation and your personal comfort level with discussing your relationship.

### Question:
is there such a thing as "real love"? you know, the kind where you never feel complete unless your partner is there? i read books about this kind of love. i see movies about it and hear songs, but i have never experienced it. i am not a teen-ager, abby. i am 47 years old and wonder if i have missed out. -- wondering in iowa
### Answer:
Dear Wondering in Iowa,
Yes, there is such a thing as "real love." It's the kind of love that makes you feel complete when your partner is with you, but also allows you to be independent and pursue your own interests. It's not about being dependent on each other or losing yourself in the relationship. Real love is based on mutual respect, trust, and communication.
As for whether you have missed out, it's never too late to find love. Love can come at any age, and it's important to remember that there are many different types of love beyond romantic relationships. You may find fulfillment in friendships, family connections, or even a passion project.
Keep an open mind and heart, and don't give up on the possibility of finding real love.

### Question:
i am a divorced woman with one child, and i'm in a relationship with a younger man. he has his own home, and i have mine. he stays at my house three nights a week and every other weekend, when my child is not with me. he eats and grooms himself in my home and swims in the community pool. he never offers to pay for anything, like food, movie tickets, etc. if we go out, he expects me to pay my own way. in today's world is there any responsibility on a man in a relationship to pay for anything other than himself? are the days of men taking women out and paying for the date gone? shouldn't he offer to bring groceries during the times he spends at my home? what should a lady expect from a man in a dating relationship? -- gal in virginia
### Answer:
Dear Gal,
In today's world, there is no set rule on who pays for dates or other expenses in a relationship. It ultimately depends on the couple and their individual preferences and financial situations. However, it sounds like your partner is taking advantage of you by not contributing to any shared expenses. If you feel uncomfortable with this arrangement, I suggest having an open conversation with him about your expectations and boundaries. You deserve to be treated with respect and consideration in a relationship, regardless of gender roles or societal norms.
