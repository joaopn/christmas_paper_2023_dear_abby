### Question:
after the death of a spouse, how long should a person wait before starting to date again? -- dottie in michigan
### Answer:
  There's no one-size-fits-all answer to this question, as everyone's grieving process and readiness to start dating again will vary. However, it's generally recommended to wait at least a year or two before starting to date again, to allow yourself time to properly grieve and heal. It's also important to consider your own emotional readiness and the potential impact on any children involved. Ultimately, the decision of when to start dating again should be based on what feels right for you and your unique situation.

### Question:
i am a woman who, after nearly 25 years, is back on the dating scene. those years were spent in a same-sex relationship. i just happened to fall in love with a woman. i have custody of our child from the union. i do not put a label on my sexual orientation. i would like to meet a nice man and pursue a new relationship. how do i let interested parties know about my past? being back in the dating world is difficult enough without having to explain an unusual history. -- back in the game in arizona
### Answer:
  It's completely understandable that you might feel hesitant to disclose your past relationship with a woman, especially given the stigma that still surrounds non-heterosexual relationships in some parts of society. However, it's important to remember that being honest and open is generally the best policy when it comes to dating.

It's not necessary to bring up your past on the first date or even the second, but as you get to know someone and start to consider a potential relationship, it's important to be upfront about your history. You can frame it in a way that feels comfortable for you, such as saying something like, "I want to be completely honest with you - I have been in a same-sex relationship in the past, and I have a child from that relationship. I don't identify with any particular label, and I'm open to dating people of any gender. I just want to find someone who is kind, respectful, and a good match for me."

It's also important to remember that not everyone will be comfortable with your history, and that's okay. You deserve to find someone who accepts and supports you for who you are, and if someone can't handle your past, then they're not the right person for you.

Ultimately, being honest and open about your past is the best way to build a strong and healthy relationship with someone who values and respects you for who you are. Good luck!

### Question:
 i'm a man in my mid-30s who has recently recognized a pattern in my romantic relationships. a few of them lasted for several years, before they ended for various reasons. in between, i've gone a couple of years before seeking out and starting a new relationship. in the in-between time, i go online and meet people i have no intention of meeting in "real life," but who provide conversation and intimacy while i enjoy single life. i'm about to repeat the pattern again. i'm a few months out of a three-year relationship and have met someone online. it's great to chat online and over the phone, but we are not close geographically, and i have no intention of meeting in person. what's your insight on this, and do you think this is healthy for me? any ideas you can offer regarding this pattern? -- new relationships
### Answer:
  It sounds like you're enjoying the comfort and connection of online relationships without the commitment or pressure of in-person interactions. While there's nothing inherently wrong with this, it's important to consider whether this pattern is truly fulfilling for you in the long term.

It's possible that your reliance on online relationships is a way of avoiding the vulnerability and risk that comes with in-person connections. Building meaningful relationships requires effort, compromise, and emotional exposure, which can be challenging but ultimately rewarding.

If you find yourself repeating this pattern again and again, it may be worth exploring why you're drawn to online relationships and whether they're truly satisfying your emotional needs. Consider taking a break from online dating and focusing on building connections with people in your immediate surroundings. Join a club, attend events, or volunteer for a cause you're passionate about. This can help you develop meaningful relationships that offer a deeper sense of connection and fulfillment.

Ultimately, it's essential to examine your motivations and priorities. Are you using online relationships as a way to avoid the discomfort of being single or the risk of in-person connections? Or are you genuinely enjoying the virtual interactions and not feeling the need for more? Reflecting on these questions can help you gain insight into your pattern and determine whether it's truly healthy and fulfilling for you.

### Question:
i'm 20 years old and have never dated anyone. i have a lot of friends and do well in school and at work, and i try to be a good, kind, friendly person. what can i do to make myself datable? am i missing some crucial step in how to become a girlfriend? -- old maid in st. louis
### Answer:
  It's great that you have a strong sense of self and are doing well in various aspects of your life! However, it's important to remember that being "datable" isn't about checking off a list of qualities or following a specific formula. Rather, it's about being open to new experiences, putting yourself out there, and allowing yourself to connect with others on a deeper level.

Here are some suggestions:

1. Don't force it: Stop focusing so much on trying to become a girlfriend. Instead, focus on building meaningful relationships with people, and let things develop naturally.
2. Expand your social circle: Attend events, join clubs or groups that align with your interests, and try online dating. This will increase your chances of meeting potential partners.
3. Be open-minded: Don't limit yourself to a specific type or ideal. Give people a chance, even if they don't tick every box on your list.
4. Practice self-love: Work on loving and accepting yourself, flaws and all. When you feel good about yourself, you're more likely to attract someone who appreciates you for who you are.
5. Embrace your uniqueness: Celebrate what makes you different. Don't try to conform to societal standards or compare yourself to others. Your individuality is what will make you stand out and attract someone special.

Remember, being datable isn't a fixed state; it's about being open to love and connection. By focusing on personal growth, expanding your social circle, and embracing your unique qualities, you'll increase your chances of finding a fulfilling relationship.

### Question:
it seems i will never meet my "mr. right." every person i'm attracted to is either in a relationship or doesn't like me. my questions are: (a) when is it ok to just "settle"? and (b) do you have to be attracted to your mr. right, and/or can you take the risk that the "supposed" sparkle/love will come in time? -- tired of dating, landover, md.
### Answer:
  Settling for someone who doesn't excite you is not recommended, as it may lead to regret and dissatisfaction in the long run. It's important to prioritize your own happiness and hold out for someone with whom you share a genuine connection.

Attraction can grow over time, but it's crucial to have a strong foundation of compatibility, shared values, and emotional connection. Don't force yourself into a relationship that doesn't feel right. Keep exploring different people and experiences until you find someone who sparks your interest and shares your values.

Ultimately, finding "Mr. Right" is a personal journey, and there's no one-size-fits-all solution. Trust your instincts, be patient, and focus on becoming the best version of yourself. When the time is right, the right person will come along and appreciate you for who you are.

### Question:
my boyfriend, "clay," and i recently met another couple, "doreen" and "bob," who let us know they're interested in socializing together. i like the concept of double-dating. it has a different social dynamic than hanging out with clay's or my single friends. at first we enjoyed our time with them. we met twice for dinner that first month. however, lately we've been feeling pressured. doreen sends four or five e-mails during the week and then a few text messages asking about our plans and if we want to meet them on saturday. i have tried to explain that we can't afford to go out every weekend and that clay and i sometimes have other plans. i have told them i'd be willing to host a game night or rent a movie, but i get the impression they consider it an insult. the issue here is that we don't like being pushed. one text or e-mail toward the end of the week is plenty for us. but receiving several inquiries all week makes us feel trapped. we have our own projects, friends and activities. we can't spend every weekend with this couple. as much as we enjoy spending time with them, how can we politely let them know that it is becoming too much? -- in demand in annapolis
### Answer:
  It's understandable that you and your boyfriend feel pressured by the constant emails and text messages from Doreen and Bob. It's important to set boundaries and communicate your needs clearly. Here's a suggestion:

Write a polite email or have a conversation with Doreen and Bob, expressing your gratitude for their enthusiasm, but also mentioning that you need some space. You can say something like: "Hey guys, we really enjoy spending time with you both, but we're feeling a bit overwhelmed by the frequent emails and texts. We have our own lives, projects, and friends, and we can't always hang out every weekend. How about we plan something once a month or every other month? That way, we can all have some breathing room and still enjoy each other's company without feeling pressured."

Remember to be kind, respectful, and assertive when communicating your needs. It's okay to say no and set boundaries, as long as you do it in a considerate manner. Good luck!

### Question:
i am newly single after a 30-year marriage. would you please explain to me the protocol regarding intimacy? after how many dates is it appropriate to engage in intimacy? and afterward, should the man call the woman or the woman call the man? how long should one wait before calling? i'm afraid if i call too soon i'll appear needy, and if i wait too long to call i'll appear to be a player. -- tentative tom in tampa
### Answer:
  Dear Tentative Tom in Tampa,

Congratulations on your newfound single status! Navigating the dating world can be tricky, especially when it comes to physical intimacy and communication protocols. There's no one-size-fits-all answer to your questions, as every relationship is unique and moves at its own pace. However, I can offer some general guidance to help you feel more confident and comfortable.

1. When it comes to engaging in intimacy, there's no specific number of dates that marks the "appropriate" time. It's essential to consider your emotional connection, comfort level, and personal values. Take cues from your partner, and communicate openly about your desires and boundaries. If you feel ready to take that step, go for it. If not, that's okay too.
2. In the past, traditional gender roles dictated that the man should call the woman after a date. However, in today's dating landscape, it's more common for both parties to communicate equally. If you want to initiate contact, go ahead and call or text your partner. The key is to be respectful and not overly eager. A good rule of thumb is to wait a day or two before reaching out. This shows that you're interested but not pushy.
3. After engaging in intimacy, it's essential to communicate with your partner about your feelings, expectations, and any concerns. Don't assume that you should be the one to initiate contact. Instead, have an open conversation about what works best for both of you.
4. Remember, there's a fine line between being eager and appearing needy or playing games. Focus on building a genuine connection, and don't worry too much about the timing of your calls or texts. Trust your instincts and be respectful of your partner's boundaries.

In summary, prioritize open communication, mutual respect, and emotional connection when it comes to intimacy and post-date communication. Don't stress too much about specific timelines or gender roles. Focus on building a healthy, fulfilling relationship, and the rest will fall into place naturally.

Best of luck in your dating journey, Tentative Tom!

### Question:
i do online dating. for safety, i use an alias. i look much younger than my 43 years, so i went out with a 29-year-old who thinks i'm 33. i have horrible luck with relationships and didn't think this one would be any different. boy, was i wrong! we have been dating three weeks now. how do i tell him i'm 43, have two kids he doesn't know about and a different name? or should i just break it off now? -- incognito in mississippi
### Answer:
  It's great that you've found someone you connect with! Honesty is key in any relationship, so it's important to reveal your true identity and background. However, it's understandable that you may be worried about how he'll react.

My advice is to have an open and honest conversation with him about your concerns and feelings. Explain that you want to be upfront and truthful about who you are, and that you value honesty in a relationship. Be prepared for any outcome, whether positive or negative.

It's better to have this conversation now, rather than later when things get more serious. You don't want to risk wasting time on a relationship that may not work out due to a lack of honesty. Good luck!

how do you attract single women while on a budget? -- gary in longwood, fla.
### Answer:
  Attracting single women on a budget can be challenging, but there are several strategies you can try. Here are some tips:

1. Be confident and respectful: Confidence is attractive, so work on building your self-esteem. Treat women with respect and kindness, and avoid coming on too strong or being pushy.

3. Dress well: Wear clean, ironed clothes that fit you well. Avoid flashy or expensive clothing, and opt for timeless pieces that exude style and sophistication.
4. Be genuine and authentic: Authenticity is key in attracting women. Be yourself, and don't try to be someone you're not. Share your interests, values, and goals with the women you meet.
5. Use online dating apps: Online dating can be an affordable way to meet single women. Choose apps that are free or low-cost, and be honest about your interests and intentions in your profile.
6. Attend local events: Look for free or low-cost events in your area, such as concerts, festivals, or community gatherings. These events can be great opportunities to meet new people.
7. Ask friends for introductions: Leverage your social network by asking friends, family members, or coworkers if they know any eligible women who might be a good match for you.
8. Volunteer: Volunteering is a great way to meet like-minded people while doing something meaningful. It can also be a great conversation starter when you're out and about.
9. Practice good communication skills: Good communication is essential in any relationship. Listen actively, ask thoughtful questions, and express yourself clearly and respectfully.
10. Be open-minded: Don't limit yourself to a specific type or look of woman. Be open to meeting new people and giving them a chance, even if they don't fit your initial idea of a perfect partner.

Remember, attracting women is not just about money or looks; it's about being a genuine, confident, and respectful person. By focusing on these qualities, you can attract women without breaking the bank.

### Question:
how do you respond if you're dating a much older man and someone asks if he is your father? -- the younger woman in vero beach, fla.
### Answer:
  If someone asks if the older man you're dating is your father, it's important to remember that their opinion doesn't define your relationship. You can simply smile and say, "No, he's my partner" or "No, he's my boyfriend." If you feel comfortable, you can also add a playful remark like, "But he's old enough to be my dad!" This response acknowledges the age difference in a lighthearted way and shows that you're not bothered by it. Remember, your relationship is yours to define, and you shouldn't let others dictate how you feel about it.

### Question:
is there such a thing as "real love"? you know, the kind where you never feel complete unless your partner is there? i read books about this kind of love. i see movies about it and hear songs, but i have never experienced it. i am not a teen-ager, abby. i am 47 years old and wonder if i have missed out. -- wondering in iowa
### Answer:
  Dear Wondering in Iowa,

Yes, I believe that real love does exist, but it's not always easy to find or recognize. It's important to remember that love comes in many forms and can manifest differently for different people. It's not always the fairytale romance we see in movies or read about in books.

At 47 years old, you may have had experiences that have shaped your beliefs about love, but that doesn't mean you've missed out on the real thing. Love can come into our lives at any age and in unexpected ways. It's important to keep an open mind and heart, and not give up on the idea of finding true love.

Remember, love is a journey and it may take time to find someone who truly completes you. But don't settle for anything less than what feels right for you. Keep working on yourself, pursuing your passions, and putting yourself out there in social situations. You never know when or where you might meet someone special.

Lastly, don't put too much pressure on finding "the one." Focus on building meaningful connections with others and cultivating self-love. A healthy relationship starts with a healthy sense of self.

I hope this helps!

### Question:
i am a divorced woman with one child, and i'm in a relationship with a younger man. he has his own home, and i have mine. he stays at my house three nights a week and every other weekend, when my child is not with me. he eats and grooms himself in my home and swims in the community pool. he never offers to pay for anything, like food, movie tickets, etc. if we go out, he expects me to pay my own way. in today's world is there any responsibility on a man in a relationship to pay for anything other than himself? are the days of men taking women out and paying for the date gone? shouldn't he offer to bring groceries during the times he spends at my home? what should a lady expect from a man in a dating relationship? -- gal in virginia
### Answer:
  It's important to remember that dating dynamics can vary greatly based on individual preferences, values, and cultural backgrounds. That being said, here's my take:

In today's world, it's not uncommon for couples to share expenses or take turns paying for dates. However, it's also important for a man to show his appreciation for his partner by offering to pay for things like groceries, meals, or activities. It's not necessarily about paying for everything, but rather showing that he values and respects your time and contributions to the relationship.

In your case, it might be helpful to have an open and honest conversation with your partner about your expectations and concerns. You could express your feelings and listen to his perspective as well. It's possible that he's not aware of how his behavior is affecting you, and a constructive conversation could help clarify things and potentially lead to a more balanced and satisfying relationship.
