### Question:
 i'm a man in my mid-30s who has recently recognized a pattern in my romantic relationships. a few of them lasted for several years, before they ended for various reasons. in between, i've gone a couple of years before seeking out and starting a new relationship. in the in-between time, i go online and meet people i have no intention of meeting in "real life," but who provide conversation and intimacy while i enjoy single life. i'm about to repeat the pattern again. i'm a few months out of a three-year relationship and have met someone online. it's great to chat online and over the phone, but we are not close geographically, and i have no intention of meeting in person. what's your insight on this, and do you think this is healthy for me? any ideas you can offer regarding this pattern? -- new relationships
### Answer:
It's great that you recognize the pattern in your relationships. It's important to reflect on what you truly want and need in a relationship. Instead of focusing on online connections that won't lead to real-life connections, consider investing in activities and experiences that bring you joy and fulfillment. Seek out shared experiences and focus on building meaningful connections with people who are geographically closer to you. This can help break the pattern and lead to more fulfilling relationships.

### Question:
my boyfriend, "clay," and i recently met another couple, "doreen" and "bob," who let us know they're interested in socializing together. i like the concept of double-dating. it has a different social dynamic than hanging out with clay's or my single friends. at first we enjoyed our time with them. we met twice for dinner that first month. however, lately we've been feeling pressured. doreen sends four or five e-mails during the week and then a few text messages asking about our plans and if we want to meet them on saturday. i have tried to explain that we can't afford to go out every weekend and that clay and i sometimes have other plans. i have told them i'd be willing to host a game night or rent a movie, but i get the impression they consider it an insult. the issue here is that we don't like being pushed. one text or e-mail toward the end of the week is plenty for us. but receiving several inquiries all week makes us feel trapped. we have our own projects, friends and activities. we can't spend every weekend with this couple. as much as we enjoy spending time with them, how can we politely let them know that it is becoming too much? -- in demand in annapolis
### Answer:
It's great that you've found a couple to socialize with, but it's important to set boundaries. You can kindly let Doreen and Bob know that while you enjoy spending time with them, you also value your own projects, friends, and activities. Suggest alternative ways to connect, like hosting a game night or renting a movie, and emphasize that you appreciate their enthusiasm but need a bit more flexibility in planning. Communication is key in maintaining a healthy balance in your social interactions.
