### Answer:
There is no set time limit for when someone should start dating after losing a spouse. It's important to take your time and grieve fully before moving on to new relationships.

### Question:
i am a woman who, after nearly 25 years, is back on the dating scene. those years were spent in a same-sex relationship. i just happened to fall in love with a woman. i have custody of our child from the union. i do not put a label on my sexual orientation. i would like to meet a nice man and pursue a new relationship. how do i let interested parties know about my past? being back in the dating world is difficult enough without having to explain an unusual history. -- back in the game in arizona
### Answer:
You don't need to disclose your past relationships or sexual orientation unless you feel it's relevant to the person you're talking to. If someone asks, be honest and open about who you are and what you've been through. However, if you prefer not to discuss your personal life with strangers, that's perfectly fine too. Focus on getting to know people as individuals and let them decide for themselves whether they want to pursue a relationship with you.

### Question:
 i'm a man in my mid-30s who has recently recognized a pattern in my romantic relationships. a few of them lasted for several years, before they ended for various reasons. in between, i've gone a couple of years before seeking out and starting a new relationship. in the in-between time, i go online and meet people i have no intention of meeting in "real life," but who provide conversation and intimacy while i enjoy single life. i'm about to repeat the pattern again. i'm a few months out of a three-year relationship and have met someone online. it's great to chat online and over the phone, but we are not close geographically, and i have no intention of meeting in person. what's your insight on this, and do you think this is healthy for me? any ideas you can offer regarding this pattern? -- new relationships
### Answer:
It sounds like you may be struggling with a fear of intimacy or commitment. While it's normal to enjoy the excitement of dating and meeting new people, it's important to also prioritize your emotional well-being and personal growth. Consider seeking therapy or counseling to work through any underlying issues that may be contributing to this pattern. Additionally, try setting boundaries with yourself and others regarding online relationships. It can be easy to get caught up in the excitement of virtual connections without fully considering their potential impact on your emotional health.

### Question:
i'm 20 years old and have never dated anyone. i have a lot of friends and do well in school and at work, and i try to be a good, kind, friendly person. what can i do to make myself datable? am i missing some crucial step in how to become a girlfriend? -- old maid in st. louis
### Answer:
You're already doing many of the things that make you an attractive and desirable partner, such as being kind, friendly, and successful. However, there are some additional steps you can take to increase your dating appeal. Firstly, work on improving your self-confidence by practicing positive affirmations and setting achievable goals for yourself. Secondly, focus on building a strong social network of friends who support and encourage you. Finally, consider joining a dating app or attending social events where you can meet potential partners. With time and effort, you will find the right person to share your life with!

### Question:
it seems i will never meet my "mr. right." every person i'm attracted to is either in a relationship or doesn't like me. my questions are: (a) when is it ok to just "settle"? and (b) do you have to be attracted to your mr. right, and/or can you take the risk that the "supposed" sparkle/love will come in time? -- tired of dating, landover, md.
### Answer:
(a) It's never okay to settle for someone who doesn't make you happy or treat you with respect. If you feel like you're constantly being rejected by the people you're attracted to, it may be time to take a break from dating and focus on yourself. You can try online dating apps or joining social groups where you might meet new people who share your interests.
(b) Attraction is important in any relationship, but it doesn't necessarily mean that love will come in time. If you feel like you have a connection with someone, even if the sparkle isn't there yet, it may be worth taking a chance on them and seeing where things go. However, if you don't feel any chemistry or compatibility, it might be best to move on and keep looking for someone who makes you feel good about yourself.

### Question:
my boyfriend, "clay," and i recently met another couple, "doreen" and "bob," who let us know they're interested in socializing together. i like the concept of double-dating. it has a different social dynamic than hanging out with clay's or my single friends. at first we enjoyed our time with them. we met twice for dinner that first month. however, lately we've been feeling pressured. doreen sends four or five e-mails during the week and then a few text messages asking about our plans and if we want to meet them on saturday. i have tried to explain that we can't afford to go out every weekend and that clay and i sometimes have other plans. i have told them i'd be willing to host a game night or rent a movie, but i get the impression they consider it an insult. the issue here is that we don't like being pushed. one text or e-mail toward the end of the week is plenty for us. but receiving several inquiries all week makes us feel trapped. we have our own projects, friends and activities. we can't spend every weekend with this couple. as much as we enjoy spending time with them, how can we politely let them know that it is becoming too much? -- in demand in annapolis
### Answer:
Dear In Demand,
It sounds like you and your boyfriend are feeling pressured by the other couple to spend every weekend together. This can be a difficult situation to navigate, especially if you enjoy their company but don't want to feel obligated to spend all of your free time with them. Here are some tips on how to politely let them know that it is becoming too much:
1. Be honest and direct: Let the other couple know that while you appreciate their interest in spending time together, you can only do so occasionally due to your own commitments. Explain that you would be happy to host a game night or rent a movie if they are interested, but that you cannot spend every weekend with them.
2. Set boundaries: Let the couple know what days and times work best for you to get together. This will help them plan their social activities around your schedule.
3. Be firm: If the couple continues to pressure you to spend more time together, be firm in your decision to limit your interactions with them. You don't have to explain why you are doing this, but simply let them know that you cannot spend every weekend with them and that you would like to maintain a healthy balance between socializing with them and other friends and activities.
4. Be polite: Even if the couple continues to pressure you, it is important to remain polite and respectful in your interactions with them. Remember that they may not be aware of how their behavior is affecting you, so try to communicate your concerns in a calm and constructive manner.
By following these tips, you can politely let the other couple know that it is becoming too much while still maintaining a healthy balance between socializing with them and other friends and activities.

### Question:
i am newly single after a 30-year marriage. would you please explain to me the protocol regarding intimacy? after how many dates is it appropriate to engage in intimacy? and afterward, should the man call the woman or the woman call the man? how long should one wait before calling? i'm afraid if i call too soon i'll appear needy, and if i wait too long to call i'll appear to be a player. -- tentative tom in tampa
### Answer:
The protocol regarding intimacy varies depending on the individuals involved. There is no set number of dates that should pass before engaging in intimacy, as it depends on the comfort level and chemistry between the two people. As for who should call afterward, it's generally considered polite for the man to initiate contact first. However, if you feel more comfortable calling, then do so without hesitation. It's better to be honest about your feelings than to play games or appear needy.

### Question:
i do online dating. for safety, i use an alias. i look much younger than my 43 years, so i went out with a 29-year-old who thinks i'm 33. i have horrible luck with relationships and didn't think this one would be any different. boy, was i wrong! we have been dating three weeks now. how do i tell him i'm 43, have two kids he doesn't know about and a different name? or should i just break it off now? -- incognito in mississippi
### Answer:
It may be difficult to tell your partner the truth without hurting his feelings. However, if you want to maintain a healthy relationship with him, it's important that he knows who you really are. You could try telling him gradually over time or wait until you feel more comfortable with each other. If you decide to break up now, be honest and respectful in your communication.

### Answer:
Greetings, Gary! Here are some tips for attracting single women on a budget:
1. Dress well and groom yourself neatly. This shows that you care about your appearance and take pride in yourself.

3. Volunteer for a cause you believe in. This shows that you have a heart and are willing to help others.

### Question:
how do you respond if you're dating a much older man and someone asks if he is your father? -- the younger woman in vero beach, fla.
### Answer:
I would advise her to be honest with the person who asked the question. If she feels comfortable doing so, she can explain that while she may look young for her age, she is not dating her father and that he is much older than her. However, if she prefers to keep this information private, she should simply say that it's none of their business and politely change the subject.

### Question:
is there such a thing as "real love"? you know, the kind where you never feel complete unless your partner is there? i read books about this kind of love. i see movies about it and hear songs, but i have never experienced it. i am not a teen-ager, abby. i am 47 years old and wonder if i have missed out. -- wondering in iowa
### Answer:
While there is no one definition of "real love," I believe that it can be found in many different forms. It may not always involve the presence of a partner, but rather a deep connection with someone who understands and supports you unconditionally. Love is about finding someone who complements your strengths and weaknesses, and who makes you feel like the best version of yourself. So while it's true that you haven't experienced this kind of love yet, don't give up hope! Keep an open mind and heart, and you may find it in unexpected places.

### Question:
i am a divorced woman with one child, and i'm in a relationship with a younger man. he has his own home, and i have mine. he stays at my house three nights a week and every other weekend, when my child is not with me. he eats and grooms himself in my home and swims in the community pool. he never offers to pay for anything, like food, movie tickets, etc. if we go out, he expects me to pay my own way. in today's world is there any responsibility on a man in a relationship to pay for anything other than himself? are the days of men taking women out and paying for the date gone? shouldn't he offer to bring groceries during the times he spends at my home? what should a lady expect from a man in a dating relationship? -- gal in virginia
### Answer:
While it is becoming more common for men and women to share expenses equally, there are still traditional gender roles that exist. In this case, the woman is providing housing and meals for her partner, so she should expect him to contribute financially when they go out or do activities together. It's also important for both partners to be respectful of each other's boundaries and needs. If your partner refuses to pay his fair share, you may need to have a conversation about it.
