### Question:
 i'm a man in my mid-30s who has recently recognized a pattern in my romantic relationships. a few of them lasted for several years, before they ended for various reasons. in between, i've gone a couple of years before seeking out and starting a new relationship. in the in-between time, i go online and meet people i have no intention of meeting in "real life," but who provide conversation and intimacy while i enjoy single life. i'm about to repeat the pattern again. i'm a few months out of a three-year relationship and have met someone online. it's great to chat online and over the phone, but we are not close geographically, and i have no intention of meeting in person. what's your insight on this, and do you think this is healthy for me? any ideas you can offer regarding this pattern? -- new relationships
### Answer:
It's wonderful that you're self-aware and recognize your patterns. It's okay to enjoy online companionship as long as it's fulfilling and not preventing you from pursuing deeper connections when you're ready. However, it's important to be honest with your online friends about your intentions to avoid hurting anyone. As for your pattern, it seems like you need time to heal and enjoy your independence after a relationship, which is perfectly healthy. When you're ready for a new relationship, focus on shared experiences and joy. Remember, love is a journey, not a destination. Enjoy every step of the way!

Dear Old Maid in St. Louis,

Firstly, remember that there's no rush or age limit to start dating. It's all about finding the right person at the right time. You're already on the right track by being kind, friendly, and successful in your personal endeavors. To make yourself more "datable", focus on being open and approachable. Show genuine interest in others, listen to their stories, and share your own. Engage in activities you love, as it's a great way to meet like-minded people. Remember, it's not about becoming a girlfriend, it's about finding a partner who appreciates you for who you are. Love will come when the time is right. Keep shining!

### Question:
it seems i will never meet my "mr. right." every person i'm attracted to is either in a relationship or doesn't like me. my questions are: (a) when is it ok to just "settle"? and (b) do you have to be attracted to your mr. right, and/or can you take the risk that the "supposed" sparkle/love will come in time? -- tired of dating, landover, md.

Dear Tired of Dating,

(a) Never settle for less than what you deserve. Love is about finding someone who complements you and brings joy to your life. It may take time, but it's worth the wait. 

(b) Attraction is important, but it's not just about physical appeal. It's about being drawn to their mind, their spirit, their values. Sometimes, the "sparkle" grows over time as you get to know the person deeper. So, yes, it's okay to take that risk. Remember, love is a journey, not a destination. Keep your heart open and stay positive. Your "Mr. Right" might be just around the corner.

### Question:
my boyfriend, "clay," and i recently met another couple, "doreen" and "bob," who let us know they're interested in socializing together. i like the concept of double-dating. it has a different social dynamic than hanging out with clay's or my single friends. at first we enjoyed our time with them. we met twice for dinner that first month. however, lately we've been feeling pressured. doreen sends four or five e-mails during the week and then a few text messages asking about our plans and if we want to meet them on saturday. i have tried to explain that we can't afford to go out every weekend and that clay and i sometimes have other plans. i have told them i'd be willing to host a game night or rent a movie, but i get the impression they consider it an insult. the issue here is that we don't like being pushed. one text or e-mail toward the end of the week is plenty for us. but receiving several inquiries all week makes us feel trapped. we have our own projects, friends and activities. we can't spend every weekend with this couple. as much as we enjoy spending time with them, how can we politely let them know that it is becoming too much? -- in demand in annapolis
### Answer:
It's wonderful that you've found a couple you enjoy socializing with, but it's important to maintain balance. You can express your feelings to Doreen and Bob in a friendly and honest way. Let them know that while you value their friendship, you also have other commitments and interests. Suggest setting a regular schedule, like meeting once a month, so it's predictable and less stressful. Remember, it's okay to set boundaries in any relationship. It's all about finding a balance that works for everyone involved.

### Question:
i am newly single after a 30-year marriage. would you please explain to me the protocol regarding intimacy? after how many dates is it appropriate to engage in intimacy? and afterward, should the man call the woman or the woman call the man? how long should one wait before calling? i'm afraid if i call too soon i'll appear needy, and if i wait too long to call i'll appear to be a player. -- tentative tom in tampa
### Answer:
Dear Tentative Tom,

There's no set rule for when to engage in intimacy. It's about when you both feel comfortable and ready. Communication is key. As for calling, it's not about gender roles but about expressing your feelings. If you enjoyed the date and want to talk, don't hesitate to call. It's not about appearing needy or like a player, it's about being genuine and showing interest. Remember, love is about joy, shared experiences, and honesty.

### Question:
i do online dating. for safety, i use an alias. i look much younger than my 43 years, so i went out with a 29-year-old who thinks i'm 33. i have horrible luck with relationships and didn't think this one would be any different. boy, was i wrong! we have been dating three weeks now. how do i tell him i'm 43, have two kids he doesn't know about and a different name? or should i just break it off now? -- incognito in mississippi
### Answer:
Dear Incognito in Mississippi,

Honesty is the foundation of any strong relationship. It's never too late to start. Begin by expressing how much you value your relationship and how important it is for you to be honest with him. Share your real age, your children, and your real name. Remember, love is about accepting each other's past and building a future together. If he truly cares for you, these revelations will not change his feelings. It might take time for him to process, but it's worth the risk for a relationship built on trust and honesty.
