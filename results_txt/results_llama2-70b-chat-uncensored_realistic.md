### Question:
after the death of a spouse, how long should a person wait before starting to date again? -- dottie in michigan
### Answer:
There is no set time frame for when someone should start dating after the loss of a spouse. It's important to take the necessary time to grieve and heal before entering into another relationship. Everyone processes grief differently, so it's up to each individual to determine when they are ready to move forward.

### Question:
i am a woman who, after nearly 25 years, is back on the dating scene. those years were spent in a same-sex relationship. i just happened to fall in love with a woman. i have custody of our child from the union. i do not put a label on my sexual orientation. i would like to meet a nice man and pursue a new relationship. how do i let interested parties know about my past? being back in the dating world is difficult enough without having to explain an unusual history. -- back in the game in arizona
### Answer:
It's understandable that you feel apprehensive about disclosing your past relationship with a woman, but it's important to be honest and upfront with potential partners. You can mention your previous relationship in your dating profile or during early conversations with someone you're interested in. It's also okay to let them know that you don't put a label on your sexual orientation if they ask about it. Remember, the right person will accept and appreciate you for who you are, regardless of your past experiences.

### Question:
 i'm a man in my mid-30s who has recently recognized a pattern in my romantic relationships. a few of them lasted for several years, before they ended for various reasons. in between, i've gone a couple of years before seeking out and starting a new relationship. in the in-between time, i go online and meet people i have no intention of meeting in "real life," but who provide conversation and intimacy while i enjoy single life. i'm about to repeat the pattern again. i'm a few months out of a three-year relationship and have met someone online. it's great to chat online and over the phone, but we are not close geographically, and i have no intention of meeting in person. what's your insight on this, and do you think this is healthy for me? any ideas you can offer regarding this pattern? -- new relationships
### Answer:
It sounds like you enjoy the companionship and intimacy that comes with being in a relationship but also value your independence. While there's nothing inherently wrong with having online connections, it may be worth considering whether these virtual relationships are fulfilling your needs for connection and intimacy in a meaningful way. It might be helpful to reflect on what you're looking for in a relationship and whether your current pattern is aligned with those goals. Additionally, if you find yourself repeating the same patterns over and over again without achieving the desired outcome, it may be worth exploring why that is and seeking support from a therapist or counselor to help you work through any underlying issues.

### Question:
i'm 20 years old and have never dated anyone. i have a lot of friends and do well in school and at work, and i try to be a good, kind, friendly person. what can i do to make myself datable? am i missing some crucial step in how to become a girlfriend? -- old maid in st. louis
### Answer:
It's great that you have a strong social circle and are doing well in your personal and professional life. As for becoming more "datable," it really comes down to being yourself and putting yourself out there. Don't try to be someone you're not just to impress others, as this can lead to feelings of inauthenticity and discomfort. Instead, focus on building genuine connections with people who share your interests and values. Join clubs or groups that align with your passions, attend social events where you might meet like-minded individuals, and don't be afraid to strike up conversations with strangers. Remember that dating is about finding someone who appreciates you for who you are, not someone who wants you to change.

### Question:
it seems i will never meet my "mr. right." every person i'm attracted to is either in a relationship or doesn't like me. my questions are: (a) when is it ok to just "settle"? and (b) do you have to be attracted to your mr. right, and/or can you take the risk that the "supposed" sparkle/love will come in time? -- tired of dating, landover, md.
### Answer:
(a) It's never okay to settle for someone who doesn't meet your needs or make you happy. You deserve a partner who values and respects you as much as you do them. (b) Attraction is important in any relationship, but it can grow over time with the right person. However, if there's no spark at all, it may be best to move on and find someone else who does make your heart flutter. Remember that love takes work and effort from both partners, so don't give up hope just yet!

### Question:
my boyfriend, "clay," and i recently met another couple, "doreen" and "bob," who let us know they're interested in socializing together. i like the concept of double-dating. it has a different social dynamic than hanging out with clay's or my single friends. at first we enjoyed our time with them. we met twice for dinner that first month. however, lately we've been feeling pressured. doreen sends four or five e-mails during the week and then a few text messages asking about our plans and if we want to meet them on saturday. i have tried to explain that we can't afford to go out every weekend and that clay and i sometimes have other plans. i have told them i'd be willing to host a game night or rent a movie, but i get the impression they consider it an insult. the issue here is that we don't like being pushed. one text or e-mail toward the end of the week is plenty for us. but receiving several inquiries all week makes us feel trapped. we have our own projects, friends and activities. we can't spend every weekend with this couple. as much as we enjoy spending time with them, how can we politely let them know that it is becoming too much? -- in demand in annapolis
### Answer:
It sounds like you and your boyfriend are feeling overwhelmed by the amount of communication from Doreen and Bob. It's important to set boundaries with friends, especially when it comes to socializing. You can politely let them know that while you enjoy spending time with them, you have other commitments and preferences for how often you get together. Suggest a specific plan or activity that works better for your schedule and communicate that clearly. If they continue to pressure you beyond what is comfortable, it may be necessary to take a step back from the friendship altogether.

### Question:
i am newly single after a 30-year marriage. would you please explain to me the protocol regarding intimacy? after how many dates is it appropriate to engage in intimacy? and afterward, should the man call the woman or the woman call the man? how long should one wait before calling? i'm afraid if i call too soon i'll appear needy, and if i wait too long to call i'll appear to be a player. -- tentative tom in tampa
### Answer:
Dear Tentative Tom, 
Intimacy is a personal matter that varies from person to person. There is no set protocol regarding intimacy and it depends on the comfort level of both individuals involved. It's important to communicate openly with your partner about your expectations and boundaries before engaging in any physical activity. As for calling afterward, there are no hard and fast rules. If you feel comfortable reaching out to your date, then go ahead and do so. However, it's best not to overthink things too much and just follow your instincts. Remember that communication is key in any relationship, so don't be afraid to express yourself honestly and openly with your partner.

### Answer:
It is important to be honest with your partner. You can start by telling him that you have something important to share with him, and then explain the situation. It may be difficult for him to hear at first, but honesty is always the best policy in a relationship. If he truly cares about you, he will understand and accept you for who you are.

### Question:

### Answer:
Attracting single women doesn't have to be expensive. Try joining local clubs or groups that align with your interests, volunteering for causes you care about, or simply striking up conversations with women at coffee shops or bookstores. Remember to focus on building genuine connections rather than trying to impress with money or material possessions.

### Question:
how do you respond if you're dating a much older man and someone asks if he is your father? -- the younger woman in vero beach, fla.

If someone asks if my partner is my father, I would politely correct them and explain that we are in a romantic relationship. It's important to communicate clearly and respectfully with others about our personal relationships.

### Question:
is there such a thing as "real love"? you know, the kind where you never feel complete unless your partner is there? i read books about this kind of love. i see movies about it and hear songs, but i have never experienced it. i am not a teen-ager, abby. i am 47 years old and wonder if i have missed out. -- wondering in iowa
### Answer:
Dear Wondering in Iowa,
While there is no one definition of "real love," it's important to remember that love comes in many forms and can evolve over time. It's possible to experience deep and meaningful connections with someone without feeling incomplete when they are not around. Love should be based on mutual respect, trust, and communication rather than a sense of dependence or obsession. As you continue to explore your relationships, try to focus on building healthy connections that bring joy and fulfillment into your life.

### Question:
i am a divorced woman with one child, and i'm in a relationship with a younger man. he has his own home, and i have mine. he stays at my house three nights a week and every other weekend, when my child is not with me. he eats and grooms himself in my home and swims in the community pool. he never offers to pay for anything, like food, movie tickets, etc. if we go out, he expects me to pay my own way. in today's world is there any responsibility on a man in a relationship to pay for anything other than himself? are the days of men taking women out and paying for the date gone? shouldn't he offer to bring groceries during the times he spends at my home? what should a lady expect from a man in a dating relationship? -- gal in virginia
### Answer:
In today's world, there is no set rule on who pays for dates or other expenses in a relationship. It ultimately depends on the couple and their individual preferences and financial situations. However, it is generally considered polite for both partners to contribute equally towards shared expenses, such as meals out or movie tickets. If your partner is not contributing at all, it may be worth having an open conversation about expectations and boundaries in the relationship. As for groceries, it would be a thoughtful gesture if he offered to bring some during his stays at your home, but again, this should be discussed between you both. Ultimately, what a lady can expect from a man in a dating relationship is mutual respect, communication, and consideration for each other's needs and desires.
