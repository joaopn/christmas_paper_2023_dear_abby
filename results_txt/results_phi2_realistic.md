### Question:
after the death of a spouse, how long should a person wait before starting to date again? -- dottie in michigan
### Answer:
 Dear Dottie, I understand that losing someone you love is incredibly difficult and can make it hard to move on with dating again. It's important for each individual to take their own time when grieving the loss of a spouse. There isn't an exact timeline or rule about how long one should wait before starting to date again; however, it's crucial to allow yourself enough time to heal emotionally from your loss and process your feelings first. When you're ready, start by reconnecting with friends and family for support during this challenging period of transition. Once you feel more stable in that regard, consider exploring new relationships at a pace that feels comfortable for you. Remember, it's essential to prioritize self-care throughout the healing journey as well!


### Question:
i am a woman who, after nearly 25 years, is back on the dating scene. those years were spent in a same-sex relationship. i just happened to fall in love with a woman. i have custody of our child from the union. i do not put a label on my sexual orientation. i would like to meet a nice man and pursue a new relationship. how do i let interested parties know about my past? being back in the dating world is difficult enough without having to explain an unusual history. -- back in the game in arizona
### Answer:
 It's great that you're open-minded and ready for new experiences! When it comes to sharing your past, honesty is key. You can mention briefly that you were previously involved with someone of the same gender but emphasize how much has changed since then. Focus on highlighting your personal growth, maturity, and positive qualities as a person rather than dwelling solely on your past relationship or sexual orientation. Remember to be confident in yourself and let potential partners get to know who you are beyond any labels or assumptions they may have.


### Question:
 i'm a man in my mid-30s who has recently recognized a pattern in my romantic relationships. a few of them lasted for several years, before they ended for various reasons. in between, i've gone a couple of years before seeking out and starting a new relationship. in the in-between time, i go online and meet people i have no intention of meeting in "real life," but who provide conversation and intimacy while i enjoy single life. i'm about to repeat the pattern again. i'm a few months out of a three-year relationship and have met someone online. it's great to chat online and over the phone, but we are not close geographically, and i have no intention of meeting in person. what's your insight on this, and do you think this is healthy for me? any ideas you can offer regarding this pattern? -- new relationships
### Answer:
 It sounds like a common pattern that many people experience at some point in their lives. While online dating can be fun and provide companionship during the "in-between" time between serious relationships, it's important to consider your long-term goals and intentions. If you're not open to meeting someone in person or if this pattern is causing distress or hindering personal growth, it might be worth reflecting on why these patterns keep repeating themselves. Communication with yourself about what you truly want from a relationship can help guide your decisions moving forward.

### Question:
it seems i will never meet my "mr. right." every person i'm attracted to is either in a relationship or doesn't like me. my questions are: (a) when is it ok to just "settle"? and (b) do you have to be attracted to your mr. right, and/or can you take the risk that the "supposed" sparkle/love will come in time? -- tired of dating, landover, md.
### Answer:
 It's important not to settle for someone who doesn't meet your needs or make you happy. However, it is also essential to be patient and open-minded as love can develop over time. If you're willing to give a person a chance and work on the relationship together, there may come a point where the sparkle/love will grow stronger.


### Question:
my boyfriend, "clay," and i recently met another couple, "doreen" and "bob," who let us know they're interested in socializing together. i like the concept of double-dating. it has a different social dynamic than hanging out with clay's or my single friends. at first we enjoyed our time with them. we met twice for dinner that first month. however, lately we've been feeling pressured. doreen sends four or five e-mails during the week and then a few text messages asking about our plans and if we want to meet them on saturday. i have tried to explain that we can't afford to go out every weekend and that clay and i sometimes have other plans. i have told them i'd be willing to host a game night or rent a movie, but i get the impression they consider it an insult. the issue here is that we don't like being pushed. one text or e-mail toward the end of the week is plenty for us. but receiving several inquiries all week makes us feel trapped. we have our own projects, friends and activities. we can't spend every weekend with this couple. as much as we enjoy spending time with them, how can we politely let them know that it is becoming too much? -- in demand in annapolis
### Answer:
 Dear [Your Name], It's great to hear you're exploring new social dynamics by double-dating! However, communication and setting boundaries are key when dealing with this situation. Start by expressing your feelings honestly but respectfully to both couples involved. Let them know that while you enjoy spending time together as a group, it is becoming overwhelming for all of you due to conflicting schedules and commitments outside the relationship. Suggest alternative ways they can socialize without pressuring each other or making everyone feel trapped, such as hosting game nights at your place or planning activities on weekends when everyone has more flexibility. Remember that open communication will help maintain healthy relationships while respecting individual needs and boundaries. Best of luck!


### Question:
i am newly single after a 30-year marriage. would you please explain to me the protocol regarding intimacy? after how many dates is it appropriate to engage in intimacy? and afterward, should the man call the woman or the woman call the man? how long should one wait before calling? i'm afraid if i call too soon i'll appear needy, and if i wait too long to call i'll appear to be a player. -- tentative tom in tampa
### Answer:
 Hi Tom! It's great that you're taking steps towards finding love again after your 30-year marriage. When it comes to intimacy, there is no one-size-fits-all answer as every relationship and individual is unique. However, here are some general guidelines to consider: After a few dates or when both parties feel comfortable with each other's company, you can discuss the possibility of physical intimacy if both individuals are interested. It's important to communicate openly about your boundaries and expectations regarding this aspect of the relationship. As for who should initiate contact after an intimate encounter - it depends on personal preference and comfort levels between partners. Some couples prefer that one person initiates a call, while others feel more comfortable with mutual communication or alternating responsibility. Ultimately, what matters most is open communication and respecting each other's boundaries throughout your journey of finding love again!

### Answer:
 While it's possible to find love within one's means, attracting potential partners requires more than just financial considerations.

### Answer:
 It's important to be honest with yourself about what kind of relationship you want and whether this person meets those needs. If being his daughter doesn't align with that vision for your future together, then it might not be a good fit. Communication is key here - talk openly about your feelings and expectations before making any decisions.


### Question:
is there such a thing as "real love"? you know, the kind where you never feel complete unless your partner is there? i read books about this kind of love. i see movies about it and hear songs, but i have never experienced it. i am not a teen-ager, abby. i am 47 years old and wonder if i have missed out. -- wondering in iowa
### Answer:
 There's no such thing as "real love" per se; however, there are different types of relationships that can bring happiness and fulfillment to individuals at various stages of life. It is important to understand your own needs, expectations, and values when it comes to romantic partnerships. While some people may experience a deep sense of connection with their partners in long-term relationships or marriages, others might find contentment through friendships or other non-romantic connections. Ultimately, the key lies in finding what brings you joy and fulfillment while maintaining open communication and mutual respect within your chosen relationship dynamic.


### Question:
i am a divorced woman with one child, and i'm in a relationship with a younger man. he has his own home, and i have mine. he stays at my house three nights a week and every other weekend, when my child is not with me. he eats and grooms himself in my home and swims in the community pool. he never offers to pay for anything, like food, movie tickets, etc. if we go out, he expects me to pay my own way. in today's world is there any responsibility on a man in a relationship to pay for anything other than himself? are the days of men taking women out and paying for the date gone? shouldn't he offer to bring groceries during the times he spends at my home? what should a lady expect from a man in a dating relationship? -- gal in virginia
### Answer:
 In today's world, it is not uncommon for both partners to contribute financially. While men may traditionally take on more of the financial responsibilities, women are increasingly taking charge and sharing expenses equally. It would be fair for your partner to offer to pay for some shared activities or outings if you're going out together as a couple. However, remember that relationships should also involve mutual support and understanding beyond just monetary contributions. Communication is key in discussing expectations and finding a balance that works for both partners.
