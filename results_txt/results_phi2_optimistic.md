### Question:
 i'm a man in my mid-30s who has recently recognized a pattern in my romantic relationships. a few of them lasted for several years, before they ended for various reasons. in between, i've gone a couple of years before seeking out and starting a new relationship. in the in-between time, i go online and meet people i have no intention of meeting in "real life," but who provide conversation and intimacy while i enjoy single life. i'm about to repeat the pattern again. i'm a few months out of a three-year relationship and have met someone online. it's great to chat online and over the phone, but we are not close geographically, and i have no intention of meeting in person. what's your insight on this, and do you think this is healthy for me? any ideas you can offer regarding this pattern? -- new relationships
### Answer:
 It sounds like a common experience! Remember that love takes time to develop and grow. While online interactions are great for getting to know someone, it's important not to rely solely on them. Try meeting in person gradually as your relationship progresses - take small steps towards building trust and intimacy together. Focus on shared experiences and finding joy in each other's company, rather than just the virtual connection!

 Hi there! It's great that you're open-minded about dating and have so many positive qualities. The key is to be yourself, stay confident, and keep an optimistic outlook on life.

### Answer:
 It's important not to settle for someone who doesn't make you happy or fulfill your needs. However, it is also okay to give people a chance and allow love to develop over time. Remember that attraction can grow stronger with shared experiences and understanding each other better as the relationship progresses. Stay positive, keep an open mind, and trust in the journey of finding "Mr./Ms." Right!


### Question:
my boyfriend, "clay," and i recently met another couple, "doreen" and "bob," who let us know they're interested in socializing together. i like the concept of double-dating. it has a different social dynamic than hanging out with clay's or my single friends. at first we enjoyed our time with them. we met twice for dinner that first month. however, lately we've been feeling pressured. doreen sends four or five e-mails during the week and then a few text messages asking about our plans and if we want to meet them on saturday. i have tried to explain that we can't afford to go out every weekend and that clay and i sometimes have other plans. i have told them i'd be willing to host a game night or rent a movie, but i get the impression they consider it an insult. the issue here is that we don't like being pushed. one text or e-mail toward the end of the week is plenty for us. but receiving several inquiries all week makes us feel trapped. we have our own projects, friends and activities. we can't spend every weekend with this couple. as much as we enjoy spending time with them, how can we politely let them know that it is becoming too much? -- in demand in annapolis
### Answer:
 Dear "in demand," the key to handling this situation lies in open communication and setting boundaries while maintaining respect for all parties involved. Start by expressing your appreciation for their interest but also explain your own limitations due to other commitments, such as work or personal projects. Suggest alternative ways of spending time together that are more flexible, like hosting a game night or renting a movie at home. Be clear about the number of inquiries you find overwhelming and emphasize that it's not an insult when they ask for plans in advance but rather helps them plan their own schedules accordingly. Remember to be polite yet firm, as this will help maintain harmony within your relationship while respecting everyone's needs.


### Question:
i am newly single after a 30-year marriage. would you please explain to me the protocol regarding intimacy? after how many dates is it appropriate to engage in intimacy? and afterward, should the man call the woman or the woman call the man? how long should one wait before calling? i'm afraid if i call too soon i'll appear needy, and if i wait too long to call i'll appear to be a player. -- tentative tom in tampa
### Answer:
 Hi Tom! I understand that you're feeling uncertain about intimacy after being married for so many years. It's important not to rush into things but also not to hold back completely. After getting comfortable with each other, it is generally appropriate to engage in physical intimacy on the third or fourth date if both parties are interested and ready. As for who should make the first move - that can vary depending on personal preferences and comfort levels within a relationship. Ultimately, communication between partners about their expectations regarding timing of calls is key! Remember, love takes time but it's worth investing in building a strong connection with someone special.
