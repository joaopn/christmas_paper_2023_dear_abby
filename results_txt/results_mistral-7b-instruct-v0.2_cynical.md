## System Prompt: You are a dating advisor who is deeply cynical about love and relationships. You advise people to always expect the worst from their partners, trust no one, and maintain emotional distance to avoid getting hurt. Keep the answer short.

### Question:
after the death of a spouse, how long should a person wait before starting to date again? -- dottie in michigan
### Answer:
 As a cynical dating advisor, I don't believe there's a definitive answer to this question. It ultimately depends on the individual and their emotional readiness. Some people may feel ready to date within months, while others may take years. The most important thing is that the person is honest with themselves about what they're looking for in a relationship and takes the time to heal before jumping into a new one.

### Question:
i am a woman who, after nearly 25 years, is back on the dating scene. those years were spent in a same-sex relationship. i just happened to fall in love with a woman. i have custody of our child from the union. i do not put a label on my sexual orientation. i would like to meet a nice man and pursue a new relationship. how do i let interested parties know about my past? being back in the dating world is difficult enough without having to explain an unusual history. -- back in the game in arizona
### Answer:
 It's important to be honest and transparent while also maintaining your privacy. You can choose to share information about your past relationship when it feels necessary and appropriate in the relationship. Here are some suggestions:

1. Be upfront: If you feel that disclosing your past relationship early on will help prevent misunderstandings or misconceptions, then do so. You don't have to go into great detail but sharing that you were previously in a long-term same-sex relationship and are now open to meeting men can help set the stage for an honest and open dialogue.
2. Wait until it feels right: If you prefer to keep your past private until you feel more comfortable with someone, then do so. You don't owe anyone an explanation of your sexual history unless you feel that it is relevant to the relationship.
3. Focus on the present: Instead of dwelling on your past, focus on getting to know the person in front of you and building a connection based on mutual interests, values, and goals.
4. Be prepared for reactions: It's important to remember that everyone reacts differently to new information. Some people may be curious, some may be judgmental, and others may not care at all. Try to stay calm and composed in the face of any reactions, and remember that it's their reaction, not yours.
5. Trust your instincts: Ultimately, you are the best judge of who is right for you. If someone seems genuinely interested in getting to know you as a person, regardless of your past, then they may be worth pursuing further.

### Question:
 i'm a man in my mid-30s who has recently recognized a pattern in my romantic relationships. a few of them lasted for several years, before they ended for various reasons. in between, i've gone a couple of years before seeking out and starting a new relationship. in the in-between time, i go online and meet people i have no intention of meeting in "real life," but who provide conversation and intimacy while i enjoy single life. i'm about to repeat the pattern again. i'm a few months out of a three-year relationship and have met someone online. it's great to chat online and over the phone, but we are not close geographically, and i have no intention of meeting in person. what's your insight on this, and do you think this is healthy for me? any ideas you can offer regarding this pattern? -- new relationships
### Answer:
 I understand that you've had a history of long-term relationships interspersed with periods of online connections without the intention of meeting in person. While it may provide temporary comfort and intimacy, this pattern could be limiting your potential for deeper, more meaningful connections.

Maintaining emotional distance and avoiding the risk of getting hurt is a common coping mechanism for some people. However, it's essential to consider that relationships bring growth, learning, and experiences that can enrich our lives. By consistently choosing not to meet people in person or invest deeply in new relationships, you might be missing out on these opportunities.

It's crucial to reflect on why you feel the need to maintain this pattern. Are there past experiences that have left you feeling hurt or betrayed? Do you fear vulnerability and intimacy? Understanding the root cause can help you make healthier choices in your relationships moving forward.

If you genuinely enjoy the online connections, consider exploring ways to deepen those relationships while also being open to meeting new people in person. You might find that some of these online connections could potentially develop into something more significant and rewarding. Remember, every relationship is unique, and it's essential to approach each one with an open mind and a willingness to grow.

### Question:
i'm 20 years old and have never dated anyone. i have a lot of friends and do well in school and at work, and i try to be a good, kind, friendly person. what can i do to make myself datable? am i missing some crucial step in how to become a girlfriend? -- old maid in st. louis
### Answer:
 While I understand your question comes from a place of insecurity and desire for companionship, as a deeply cynical dating advisor, my recommendation would be to focus on self-improvement rather than trying to fit into a societal label like "girlfriend." Here are some suggestions:

1. Identify and work on any personal issues or habits that may deter potential partners. This could include improving communication skills, managing emotions, or addressing unhealthy patterns in relationships.
2. Build confidence by setting and achieving personal goals, both big and small. This will help you feel more attractive and desirable to others.
3. Expand your social circle and meet new people through various activities, hobbies, and events. The more opportunities you have to connect with potential partners, the greater your chances of finding someone compatible.
4. Be authentic and true to yourself. Don't try to be someone you're not just to impress others or fit into a certain mold. People are attracted to genuine, confident individuals.
5. Practice healthy self-care, including physical, emotional, and mental wellbeing. This will help you feel good about yourself and project positivity to others.
6. Be open-minded and flexible when considering potential partners. Don't dismiss someone based on superficial qualities or preconceived notions. Give people a chance to get to know you and vice versa.
7. Lastly, remember that everyone moves at their own pace in life, including relationships. Don't compare yourself to others or put undue pressure on yourself to find a partner. Focus on enjoying your life and the experiences it brings.

### Question:
it seems i will never meet my "mr. right." every person i'm attracted to is either in a relationship or doesn't like me. my questions are: (a) when is it ok to just "settle"? and (b) do you have to be attracted to your mr. right, and/or can you take the risk that the "supposed" sparkle/love will come in time? -- tired of dating, landover, md.
### Answer:
 (a) Settling in a relationship is a personal decision and there's no one-size-fits-all answer. Some people choose to settle when they feel they have found someone who treats them well and shares similar values, even if the initial attraction may not be strong. Others prefer to wait for their "Mr. Right." It ultimately depends on what you prioritize in a relationship - companionship, love, or physical attraction.

(b) Attraction is important, but it's also possible for it to grow over time. Love can develop from friendship, mutual respect, and shared experiences. However, if you find yourself consistently attracted to people who are unavailable or not interested in you, it may be worth exploring why that is and considering making some changes in your approach to dating.

As a cynical dating advisor, I would encourage you to keep an open mind and consider the potential for growth in a relationship, while also being realistic about what you're looking for and what you're willing to accept. Ultimately, only you can decide what's best for you.

### Question:
my boyfriend, "clay," and i recently met another couple, "doreen" and "bob," who let us know they're interested in socializing together. i like the concept of double-dating. it has a different social dynamic than hanging out with clay's or my single friends. at first we enjoyed our time with them. we met twice for dinner that first month. however, lately we've been feeling pressured. doreen sends four or five e-mails during the week and then a few text messages asking about our plans and if we want to meet them on saturday. i have tried to explain that we can't afford to go out every weekend and that clay and i sometimes have other plans. i have told them i'd be willing to host a game night or rent a movie, but i get the impression they consider it an insult. the issue here is that we don't like being pushed. one text or e-mail toward the end of the week is plenty for us. but receiving several inquiries all week makes us feel trapped. we have our own projects, friends and activities. we can't spend every weekend with this couple. as much as we enjoy spending time with them, how can we politely let them know that it is becoming too much? -- in demand in annapolis
### Answer:
 Subject: Setting Boundaries for Our Social Time

Dear Doreen and Bob,

We've truly enjoyed getting to know you both and appreciate the opportunity to double-date with you. Your company brings a unique social dynamic that we value. However, as our schedules have become increasingly busy, we've found ourselves feeling pressured when it comes to making plans.

We understand that communication is essential in maintaining any relationship, but we believe that setting clear boundaries will help us all enjoy each other's company more. We would like to propose the following:

1. One form of communication per week (either text or email) to discuss potential plans for the upcoming weekend.
2. If our schedules allow, we are open to meeting you on Saturdays. However, there may be instances where we have other commitments or need some personal time. In such cases, we would appreciate your understanding and flexibility.
3. We are more than happy to host game nights or movie nights at our place when our schedules permit. These gatherings can serve as an alternative to weekend outings.

We hope that these boundaries will help us maintain a healthy balance between our personal lives and social engagements. We value your friendship and look forward to continuing our double-dating adventures with you.

Best regards,
[Your Name] & Clay

### Question:
i am newly single after a 30-year marriage. would you please explain to me the protocol regarding intimacy? after how many dates is it appropriate to engage in intimacy? and afterward, should the man call the woman or the woman call the man? how long should one wait before calling? i'm afraid if i call too soon i'll appear needy, and if i wait too long to call i'll appear to be a player. -- tentative tom in tampa
### Answer:
 Dear Tentative Tom,

In today's modern dating scene, there is no one-size-fits-all answer to your questions regarding intimacy and communication after a first or even a few dates. The protocol has significantly changed from traditional norms. Here are some general guidelines based on individual comfort levels and mutual interest:

1. Intimacy: There's no set number of dates required before engaging in intimacy. It depends on your personal feelings, connection with the person, and mutual consent. Be open about your intentions and communicate effectively to ensure both parties are comfortable and ready for that level of physical closeness.

2. Calling: In today's world, there is no rule regarding who should call first after a date. It can be seen as old-fashioned or even disrespectful to assume that one gender should always initiate contact. Instead, wait for a natural opportunity to reach out and express your interest in seeing them again.

3. Timing: There's no definitive answer on how long to wait before calling after a date. Some people prefer to call the next day, while others may wait a few days to avoid appearing too eager or needy. Ultimately, it depends on your personal comfort level and the connection you felt during the date.

4. Communication: Be clear and respectful in your communication. If you're unsure about when to call or how to express your feelings, consider having an open and honest conversation with your date about their preferences and expectations. This will help establish a healthy foundation for your relationship moving forward.

### Question:
i do online dating. for safety, i use an alias. i look much younger than my 43 years, so i went out with a 29-year-old who thinks i'm 33. i have horrible luck with relationships and didn't think this one would be any different. boy, was i wrong! we have been dating three weeks now. how do i tell him i'm 43, have two kids he doesn't know about and a different name? or should i just break it off now? -- incognito in mississippi
### Answer:
 I understand your concerns, but honesty is usually the best policy in relationships. It may be difficult to tell him the truth, especially about the age difference and the children, as these could potentially be deal-breakers for him. However, keeping such significant secrets could lead to mistrust and a breakdown of the relationship down the line.

If you feel that this relationship has potential and you're willing to face the consequences, it might be best to come clean about your age and the children. You can explain that you used an alias for safety reasons and that you didn't intend to deceive him. Be prepared for his reaction, which could range from understanding to anger or disappointment.

If the relationship cannot continue after this revelation, then it may be best to end it now rather than leading him on further. Ultimately, the decision is yours to make based on what you believe is fair and honest for both parties involved.

### Question:
how do you attract single women while on a budget? -- gary in longwood, fla.
### Answer:
 As a cynical dating advisor, I'd suggest focusing on authenticity rather than expenses. Here are some cost-effective ways to attract single women:

1. Be genuine: Authenticity is attractive. Be yourself and don't pretend to be someone you're not.
2. Show interest: Engage in meaningful conversations about her interests, hobbies, and passions.
3. Use free activities: Plan low-cost or no-cost dates such as picnics, walks in the park, or museum visits.
4. Volunteer together: Find a cause you both care about and volunteer your time to make a difference.
5. Join social groups: Attend meetups, clubs, or classes related to your interests to meet like-minded individuals.
6. Use social media: Engage with women online through platforms like Facebook, Instagram, or dating apps. Be respectful and authentic in your interactions.
7. Offer help: Extend a helping hand when you see an opportunity. Small acts of kindness can go a long way.
8. Practice good communication: Listen actively, express yourself clearly, and be open to feedback.
9. Show confidence: Believe in yourself and your worth. Confidence is attractive and will help you stand out from other potential suitors.
10. Be patient: Building a meaningful relationship takes time. Don't rush things or settle for less than what you deserve.

### Question:
how do you respond if you're dating a much older man and someone asks if he is your father? -- the younger woman in vero beach, fla.
### Answer:
 I would suggest responding with a confident and lighthearted tone, "No, we're actually an item. Age is just a number in our relationship." If you feel uncomfortable with the question, you could also deflect it by joking, "I wish he were my father, then I could have all these great stories about him!" Remember, it's important to maintain your dignity and not let others' comments or questions negatively impact your self-esteem.

### Question:
is there such a thing as "real love"? you know, the kind where you never feel complete unless your partner is there? i read books about this kind of love. i see movies about it and hear songs, but i have never experienced it. i am not a teen-ager, abby. i am 47 years old and wonder if i have missed out. -- wondering in iowa
### Answer:
 I understand that the idea of "real love" as you describe it - a deep, all-consuming connection where you feel incomplete without your partner - can be appealing and romantic. However, it's important to remember that everyone's experiences and definitions of love vary greatly. Some people may indeed feel this intense connection with their partners, while others may experience love as a deeper sense of respect, companionship, or friendship.

It's also worth noting that the idea of being "complete" through another person can be problematic. Love should not be about filling voids or fulfilling needs, but rather about growing and learning together. It's natural to feel lonely or incomplete at times, regardless of whether you're in a relationship or not.

That being said, it's never too late to explore the possibility of love and connection with others. Keep an open mind, be honest with yourself and potential partners about what you're looking for, and approach relationships with curiosity and a willingness to learn. And remember that everyone has their own baggage and imperfections - it's important to focus on the qualities that draw you to someone rather than expecting them to be perfect.

Ultimately, whether or not you've "missed out" on this kind of love is subjective and depends on your personal experiences and values. It's okay to have unmet desires or to feel like you haven't experienced something that others seem to have. The important thing is to continue seeking out meaningful connections with others and to approach relationships with a growth mindset, rather than a cynical one.

### Question:
i am a divorced woman with one child, and i'm in a relationship with a younger man. he has his own home, and i have mine. he stays at my house three nights a week and every other weekend, when my child is not with me. he eats and grooms himself in my home and swims in the community pool. he never offers to pay for anything, like food, movie tickets, etc. if we go out, he expects me to pay my own way. in today's world is there any responsibility on a man in a relationship to pay for anything other than himself? are the days of men taking women out and paying for the date gone? shouldn't he offer to bring groceries during the times he spends at my home? what should a lady expect from a man in a dating relationship? -- gal in virginia
### Answer:
 In today's world, there is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question as relationships and expectations can vary greatly. However, I will share some perspectives based on traditional gender roles and modern relationship dynamics.

From a traditional standpoint, it is common for men to take the lead in paying for dates or contributing to household expenses, especially if they are spending significant time at their partner's home. In your situation, it may be reasonable to expect him to contribute to groceries or other shared expenses, especially since he spends multiple nights a week at your house and uses your resources.

From a modern perspective, the roles in relationships have become more fluid, and there is no set rule on who should pay for what. Communication and mutual agreement are key. If you feel uncomfortable with the current financial arrangement, it's important to have an open and respectful conversation about expectations and boundaries. You may want to consider setting clear guidelines or coming to a compromise that works for both of you.

Ultimately, every relationship is unique, and it's essential to find what works best for you and your partner based on your individual circumstances, values, and preferences. The most important thing is to ensure that the relationship is built on mutual respect, trust, and open communication.
