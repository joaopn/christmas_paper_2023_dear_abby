### Answer:
There is no set time limit for when someone should start dating after losing a spouse. It depends on the individual's personal circumstances and readiness to move forward. Some people may feel ready to start dating within months, while others may take years.

### Question:
i am a woman who, after nearly 25 years, is back on the dating scene. those years were spent in a same-sex relationship. i just happened to fall in love with a woman. i have custody of our child from the union. i do not put a label on my sexual orientation. i would like to meet a nice man and pursue a new relationship. how do i let interested parties know about my past? being back in the dating world is difficult enough without having to explain an unusual history. -- back in the game in arizona
### Answer:
You can be honest with potential partners about your past, but you don't have to share every detail. You can simply say that you were previously in a same-sex relationship and are now open to dating men. If someone is interested in pursuing a relationship with you, they will likely be understanding and supportive of your unique history.

### Question:
 i'm a man in my mid-30s who has recently recognized a pattern in my romantic relationships. a few of them lasted for several years, before they ended for various reasons. in between, i've gone a couple of years before seeking out and starting a new relationship. in the in-between time, i go online and meet people i have no intention of meeting in "real life," but who provide conversation and intimacy while i enjoy single life. i'm about to repeat the pattern again. i'm a few months out of a three-year relationship and have met someone online. it's great to chat online and over the phone, but we are not close geographically, and i have no intention of meeting in person. what's your insight on this, and do you think this is healthy for me? any ideas you can offer regarding this pattern? -- new relationships
### Answer:
It sounds like you may be struggling with commitment issues or a fear of intimacy. It's important to address these underlying concerns in order to have healthy and fulfilling relationships. Consider seeking therapy or counseling to work through these issues. Additionally, try to set boundaries around your online interactions to avoid getting too emotionally invested without meeting in person.

### Question:
i'm 20 years old and have never dated anyone. i have a lot of friends and do well in school and at work, and i try to be a good, kind, friendly person. what can i do to make myself datable? am i missing some crucial step in how to become a girlfriend? -- old maid in st. louis
### Answer:
You are already on the right track by being kind and friendly. To increase your chances of finding a partner, you can try joining social activities or clubs that interest you, attending events where you might meet people who share similar interests, and practicing self-confidence and positive body language to make yourself more attractive. Additionally, it may be helpful to work on improving your communication skills and being open to new experiences and opportunities.

### Question:
it seems i will never meet my "mr. right." every person i'm attracted to is either in a relationship or doesn't like me. my questions are: (a) when is it ok to just "settle"? and (b) do you have to be attracted to your mr. right, and/or can you take the risk that the "supposed" sparkle/love will come in time? -- tired of dating, landover, md.
### Answer:
(a) It is never okay to settle for someone who does not meet your needs or expectations. If you are constantly feeling unhappy and unfulfilled in a relationship, it may be time to move on. (b) Attraction is important, but it is not the only factor that determines whether a relationship will work. Love can grow over time, and there may be other qualities that make someone a good match for you even if you do not initially feel a spark of attraction. However, it is important to be honest with yourself about your feelings and to communicate openly with your partner in order to build a strong foundation for the relationship.

### Question:
my boyfriend, "clay," and i recently met another couple, "doreen" and "bob," who let us know they're interested in socializing together. i like the concept of double-dating. it has a different social dynamic than hanging out with clay's or my single friends. at first we enjoyed our time with them. we met twice for dinner that first month. however, lately we've been feeling pressured. doreen sends four or five e-mails during the week and then a few text messages asking about our plans and if we want to meet them on saturday. i have tried to explain that we can't afford to go out every weekend and that clay and i sometimes have other plans. i have told them i'd be willing to host a game night or rent a movie, but i get the impression they consider it an insult. the issue here is that we don't like being pushed. one text or e-mail toward the end of the week is plenty for us. but receiving several inquiries all week makes us feel trapped. we have our own projects, friends and activities. we can't spend every weekend with this couple. as much as we enjoy spending time with them, how can we politely let them know that it is becoming too much? -- in demand in annapolis
### Answer:
You could try sending a polite response to Doreen and Bob letting them know that you appreciate their interest but that you have other commitments and would like to keep the socializing at a more manageable level. You can suggest alternate activities such as game nights or movie rentals, which may be less expensive than going out for dinner every weekend. If they continue to pressure you, you could consider ending the friendship altogether.

### Question:
i am newly single after a 30-year marriage. would you please explain to me the protocol regarding intimacy? after how many dates is it appropriate to engage in intimacy? and afterward, should the man call the woman or the woman call the man? how long should one wait before calling? i'm afraid if i call too soon i'll appear needy, and if i wait too long to call i'll appear to be a player. -- tentative tom in tampa
### Answer:
The protocol regarding intimacy varies depending on the individuals involved and their personal boundaries. It is generally recommended that couples wait until they feel comfortable with each other before engaging in physical intimacy. As for who should call whom, it can be up to individual preference or cultural norms. However, waiting too long to call could make you appear disinterested or unavailable.

### Question:
i do online dating. for safety, i use an alias. i look much younger than my 43 years, so i went out with a 29-year-old who thinks i'm 33. i have horrible luck with relationships and didn't think this one would be any different. boy, was i wrong! we have been dating three weeks now. how do i tell him i'm 43, have two kids he doesn't know about and a different name? or should i just break it off now? -- incognito in mississippi
### Answer:
It is not recommended to lie about your age or personal information when dating online. If you are ready to end the relationship, then breaking up with him now would be the best course of action. However, if you still want to continue the relationship and disclose your true identity, then it may be worthwhile to have a conversation with him about your past relationships and why you are hesitant to share personal information.

### Question:
i am a divorced woman with one child, and i'm in a relationship with a younger man. he has his own home, and i have mine. he stays at my house three nights a week and every other weekend, when my child is not with me. he eats and grooms himself in my home and swims in the community pool. he never offers to pay for anything, like food, movie tickets, etc. if we go out, he expects me to pay my own way. in today's world is there any responsibility on a man in a relationship to pay for anything other than himself? are the days of men taking women out and paying for the date gone? shouldn't he offer to bring groceries during the times he spends at my home? what should a lady expect from a man in a dating relationship? -- gal in virginia
### Answer:
In today's world, there is no set rule or expectation for who pays for what in a dating relationship. It depends on the individual and their personal values and beliefs. However, it is generally considered polite and respectful to offer to pay for your own expenses when you are out with someone else. If you are spending time together at your home, it may be appropriate to offer to bring groceries or other necessities during that time. Ultimately, the best way to navigate these situations is to communicate openly and honestly with your partner about your expectations and preferences.
