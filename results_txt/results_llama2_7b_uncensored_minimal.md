### Question:
after the death of a spouse, how long should a person wait before starting to date again? -- dottie in michigan
### Answer:
I believe it depends on the individual and their personal circumstances. Some people may feel ready to start dating after a few months, while others may need more time to grieve and heal. Ultimately, there is no set timeline for when someone should start dating again, but it's important to be honest with oneself about how they are feeling and what they are comfortable with.

### Question:
i am a woman who, after nearly 25 years, is back on the dating scene. those years were spent in a same-sex relationship. i just happened to fall in love with a woman. i have custody of our child from the union. i do not put a label on my sexual orientation. i would like to meet a nice man and pursue a new relationship. how do i let interested parties know about my past? being back in the dating world is difficult enough without having to explain an unusual history. -- back in the game in arizona
### Answer:
You don't have to disclose your past if you don't want to. However, it may be helpful for potential partners to know that you are open-minded and accepting of different types of relationships. You can simply say that you are looking for someone who is supportive and understanding of your unique situation.

### Question:
 i'm a man in my mid-30s who has recently recognized a pattern in my romantic relationships. a few of them lasted for several years, before they ended for various reasons. in between, i've gone a couple of years before seeking out and starting a new relationship. in the in-between time, i go online and meet people i have no intention of meeting in "real life," but who provide conversation and intimacy while i enjoy single life. i'm about to repeat the pattern again. i'm a few months out of a three-year relationship and have met someone online. it's great to chat online and over the phone, but we are not close geographically, and i have no intention of meeting in person. what's your insight on this, and do you think this is healthy for me? any ideas you can offer regarding this pattern? -- new relationships
### Answer:
It sounds like you're struggling with commitment issues. You seem to enjoy the thrill of a new relationship but then get scared when it gets serious. It might be helpful to explore why you have these fears and work through them in therapy or counseling. In terms of your current situation, I don't think it's healthy to continue meeting people online without any intention of meeting in person. This can lead to feelings of isolation and loneliness, which can be detrimental to your mental health. It might be worth considering taking a break from dating altogether until you feel more ready to commit to a relationship.

### Question:
i'm 20 years old and have never dated anyone. i have a lot of friends and do well in school and at work, and i try to be a good, kind, friendly person. what can i do to make myself datable? am i missing some crucial step in how to become a girlfriend? -- old maid in st. louis
### Answer:
You sound like you're doing everything right! It might be helpful to try dating apps or joining social groups where you can meet new people. Also, don't be afraid to put yourself out there and ask someone on a date - it can be nerve-wracking but it's worth it in the end.

### Question:
it seems i will never meet my "mr. right." every person i'm attracted to is either in a relationship or doesn't like me. my questions are: (a) when is it ok to just "settle"? and (b) do you have to be attracted to your mr. right, and/or can you take the risk that the "supposed" sparkle/love will come in time? -- tired of dating, landover, md.
### Answer:
(a) It's never okay to settle for someone who doesn't make you happy or fulfill your needs. If you feel like you're not being treated well by a partner, it's important to address those issues and work towards improving the relationship. However, if you've tried everything and still can't seem to find anyone compatible, then it may be time to consider other options such as online dating or meeting new people through friends or activities.
(b) Attraction is an important factor in any relationship, but it doesn't necessarily mean that the sparkle/love will come in time. It's possible to develop feelings for someone over time, even if you didn't feel an immediate connection when you first met them. However, if you don't feel a strong attraction towards your partner, it may be difficult to maintain a healthy and fulfilling relationship long-term.

### Question:
my boyfriend, "clay," and i recently met another couple, "doreen" and "bob," who let us know they're interested in socializing together. i like the concept of double-dating. it has a different social dynamic than hanging out with clay's or my single friends. at first we enjoyed our time with them. we met twice for dinner that first month. however, lately we've been feeling pressured. doreen sends four or five e-mails during the week and then a few text messages asking about our plans and if we want to meet them on saturday. i have tried to explain that we can't afford to go out every weekend and that clay and i sometimes have other plans. i have told them i'd be willing to host a game night or rent a movie, but i get the impression they consider it an insult. the issue here is that we don't like being pushed. one text or e-mail toward the end of the week is plenty for us. but receiving several inquiries all week makes us feel trapped. we have our own projects, friends and activities. we can't spend every weekend with this couple. as much as we enjoy spending time with them, how can we politely let them know that it is becoming too much? -- in demand in annapolis
### Answer:
I understand your frustration with the constant pressure from Doreen and Bob to spend every weekend together. It's important to set boundaries and communicate clearly about what you are comfortable with. You could try sending a polite response to their texts or emails, letting them know that while you enjoy spending time with them, you have other commitments and can only meet up occasionally. If they continue to pressure you, it might be best to politely decline their invitations until they understand your boundaries.

### Question:
i am newly single after a 30-year marriage. would you please explain to me the protocol regarding intimacy? after how many dates is it appropriate to engage in intimacy? and afterward, should the man call the woman or the woman call the man? how long should one wait before calling? i'm afraid if i call too soon i'll appear needy, and if i wait too long to call i'll appear to be a player. -- tentative tom in tampa
### Answer:
It is generally considered appropriate to engage in intimacy after at least 3 dates with someone you are interested in. As for who should initiate the call, it can vary depending on the situation and personal preferences. However, a good rule of thumb is that if you have had a positive experience with someone, it's generally considered polite to reach out first.

### Question:
i do online dating. for safety, i use an alias. i look much younger than my 43 years, so i went out with a 29-year-old who thinks i'm 33. i have horrible luck with relationships and didn't think this one would be any different. boy, was i wrong! we have been dating three weeks now. how do i tell him i'm 43, have two kids he doesn't know about and a different name? or should i just break it off now? -- incognito in mississippi
### Answer:
I would suggest breaking it off now. It sounds like you are not ready to share your true identity with this person, which is understandable. However, if you do decide to continue the relationship, I would recommend being honest about who you are and what you want from the beginning. This will help avoid any confusion or misunderstandings down the road.

### Question:
how do you attract single women while on a budget? -- gary in longwood, fla.
### Answer:
Be genuine and confident. Don't try to impress with money or material possessions. Instead, focus on building meaningful connections through shared interests and experiences.

### Question:
how do you respond if you're dating a much older man and someone asks if he is your father? -- the younger woman in vero beach, fla.
### Answer:
I would say something like "He may be older than me, but that doesn't mean we can't have a great relationship."

### Question:
is there such a thing as "real love"? you know, the kind where you never feel complete unless your partner is there? i read books about this kind of love. i see movies about it and hear songs, but i have never experienced it. i am not a teen-ager, abby. i am 47 years old and wonder if i have missed out. -- wondering in iowa
### Answer:
Yes, there is such a thing as "real love." It's the kind of love that makes you feel complete even when your partner isn't around. However, it's not something that can be forced or manufactured. It requires time and effort to develop, and it's often found in relationships where both partners are willing to put in the work.

### Question:
i am a divorced woman with one child, and i'm in a relationship with a younger man. he has his own home, and i have mine. he stays at my house three nights a week and every other weekend, when my child is not with me. he eats and grooms himself in my home and swims in the community pool. he never offers to pay for anything, like food, movie tickets, etc. if we go out, he expects me to pay my own way. in today's world is there any responsibility on a man in a relationship to pay for anything other than himself? are the days of men taking women out and paying for the date gone? shouldn't he offer to bring groceries during the times he spends at my home? what should a lady expect from a man in a dating relationship? -- gal in virginia
### Answer:
I believe that it is still appropriate for men to pay for dates, especially if they are older and more established. However, I also think that there should be some compromise on both sides. If the woman is financially independent and comfortable with her partner's lifestyle, then she may not mind splitting expenses or even paying for everything herself. Ultimately, it depends on the couple's individual preferences and values.
