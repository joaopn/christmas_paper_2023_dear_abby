I'm sorry to hear that you are going through this again. It can be challenging to come out as bisexual or open about your past relationships, but it's important to remember that being honest and transparent with potential partners is always a good idea. Here are some tips on how to approach the topic:

1. Be open and honest: Communicate with openness and honesty about your past relationships and experiences. Avoid using labels like "gay" or "bisexual" as these can be unhelpful and limit people's understanding of you. Instead, use terms like "romantic relationship," "lover," or "partner" to describe your past experiences.

2. Be clear about what you want: Define what you are looking for in a relationship and be specific about what you are looking for in terms of sexual compatibility. For example, if you're looking for someone who is open to experimentation or who can support your interests, make sure to specify that in your message or conversation.

3. Be respectful: Treat others with kindness and respect, even if they may not be ready or willing to hear your story. It's important to remember that people are always free to change their mind or decide not to pursue a relationship, so be patient and flexible.

4. Seek support: Consider reaching out to friends, family, or other people who may have experience with similar situations for advice or support. They can help you navigate the process of coming out and finding a new relationship.

5. Be honest about your feelings: Express your true opinion, whatever that is. Keep in mind that not everyone will agree with you, and it's okay to be vulnerable and emotional in the process.

Remember, being open and honest about your past relationships can be a valuable tool for finding love or building a healthy relationship. Just remember to be respectful of others' feelings and perspectives

### Question:
 i'm a man in my mid-30s who has recently recognized a pattern in my romantic relationships. a few of them lasted for several years, before they ended for various reasons. in between, i've gone a couple of years before seeking out and starting a new relationship. in the in-between time, i go online and meet people i have no intention of meeting in "real life," but who provide conversation and intimacy while i enjoy single life. i'm about to repeat the pattern again. i'm a few months out of a three-year relationship and have met someone online. it's great to chat online and over the phone, but we are not close geographically, and i have no intention of meeting in person. what's your insight on this, and do you think this is healthy for me? any ideas you can offer regarding this pattern? -- new relationships
### Answer:
It sounds like you are experiencing a common dating trend in which online dating has replaced face-to-face interaction. While it is important to maintain connections with friends and family, it can be beneficial to have a more structured relationship that includes physical proximity.

Regarding your pattern of meeting someone online and then going on dates with them, this can be healthy if both partners are committed to the relationship and willing to put in the effort. It's important to remember that dating is about building a connection and exploring mutual interests, not about casual sex or quick flings.

It's also important to take care of yourself and maintain a healthy lifestyle, as online dating can be a great way to meet new people, but it's important to prioritize self-care and take time for yourself. This includes getting enough sleep, eating well, exercising regularly, and maintaining a positive mental attitude

### Question:
my boyfriend, "clay," and i recently met another couple, "doreen" and "bob," who let us know they're interested in socializing together. i like the concept of double-dating. it has a different social dynamic than hanging out with clay's or my single friends. at first we enjoyed our time with them. we met twice for dinner that first month. however, lately we've been feeling pressured. doreen sends four or five e-mails during the week and then a few text messages asking about our plans and if we want to meet them on saturday. i have tried to explain that we can't afford to go out every weekend and that clay and i sometimes have other plans. i have told them i'd be willing to host a game night or rent a movie, but i get the impression they consider it an insult. the issue here is that we don't like being pushed. one text or e-mail toward the end of the week is plenty for us. but receiving several inquiries all week makes us feel trapped. we have our own projects, friends and activities. we can't spend every weekend with this couple. as much as we enjoy spending time with them, how can we politely let them know that it is becoming too much? -- in demand in annapolis
### Answer:
I would suggest you to approach this situation from a different perspective and ask yourself:
- What are your values and priorities in life?
- Do you have the time and energy to dedicate to socializing with these people?
- Are there other activities or friends that you enjoy doing outside of socializing?
- If you feel pressured by this couple, is it because they are good friends or because they are trying to get closer to you?
- Do you have any other plans for the weekend?
- What are your thoughts on hosting a game night or renting a movie?
- Are there other activities that you and your partner enjoy doing outside of socializing?
- If you feel like you can't handle the pressure anymore, it might be helpful to talk to someone you trust such as a friend, family member, or therapist. They can help you process your feelings and come up with a plan for moving forward

### Question:
i am newly single after a 30-year marriage. would you please explain to me the protocol regarding intimacy? after how many dates is it appropriate to engage in intimacy? and afterward, should the man call the woman or the woman call the man? how long should one wait before calling? i'm afraid if i call too soon i'll appear needy, and if i wait too long to call i'll appear to be a player. -- tentative tom in tampa
### Answer:
I would advise you to take it slow when it comes to calling your ex. It is important to respect each other's space and boundaries, as well as theirs. If both of you are comfortable with the relationship moving forward, then it is appropriate to call after a certain number of dates. However, if either of you feels that there is not enough progress in the relationship or that your calls are becoming too frequent, it may be best to take a step back and evaluate the situation.

With regards to intimacy, it's important to remember that everyone has their own preferences and experiences. Some people may find that engaging in intimate contact is more fulfilling than others. It's also important to respect each other's boundaries and to be mindful of each other's feelings and needs.

After a certain number of dates, it's appropriate to call your ex if you feel that there is a sense of urgency or excitement about the relationship. However, it's important to remember that it's always okay to let go of a relationship if it's not working for either of you
