### Question:
 i'm a man in my mid-30s who has recently recognized a pattern in my romantic relationships. a few of them lasted for several years, before they ended for various reasons. in between, i've gone a couple of years before seeking out and starting a new relationship. in the in-between time, i go online and meet people i have no intention of meeting in "real life," but who provide conversation and intimacy while i enjoy single life. i'm about to repeat the pattern again. i'm a few months out of a three-year relationship and have met someone online. it's great to chat online and over the phone, but we are not close geographically, and i have no intention of meeting in person. what's your insight on this, and do you think this is healthy for me? any ideas you can offer regarding this pattern? -- new relationships
### Answer:
It sounds like you may be using these online relationships as a way to fill a void between your more serious, in-person relationships. While it's natural to seek connection, it's important to be honest with yourself and others about your intentions. Consider taking a break from seeking out new online relationships and focus on self-reflection and personal growth. It's important to be mindful of the impact your actions may have on others. Therapy could also be beneficial in exploring and addressing this pattern.

### Answer:
You're not an old maid, and there's no "crucial step" to becoming a girlfriend. Focus on being yourself, pursuing your interests, and being open to meeting new people. The right person will appreciate you for who you are. Don't rush into a relationship just for the sake of being in one. Enjoy your life and the right person will come along when the time is right.

### Question:
it seems i will never meet my "mr. right." every person i'm attracted to is either in a relationship or doesn't like me. my questions are: (a) when is it ok to just "settle"? and (b) do you have to be attracted to your mr. right, and/or can you take the risk that the "supposed" sparkle/love will come in time? -- tired of dating, landover, md.
### Answer:
(a) It's never okay to "settle" for someone just because you're tired of dating. (b) It's important to be attracted to your partner, but love can grow over time. Don't rush into a relationship just for the sake of being in one. Focus on being the best version of yourself and the right person will come along.

### Question:
my boyfriend, "clay," and i recently met another couple, "doreen" and "bob," who let us know they're interested in socializing together. i like the concept of double-dating. it has a different social dynamic than hanging out with clay's or my single friends. at first we enjoyed our time with them. we met twice for dinner that first month. however, lately we've been feeling pressured. doreen sends four or five e-mails during the week and then a few text messages asking about our plans and if we want to meet them on saturday. i have tried to explain that we can't afford to go out every weekend and that clay and i sometimes have other plans. i have told them i'd be willing to host a game night or rent a movie, but i get the impression they consider it an insult. the issue here is that we don't like being pushed. one text or e-mail toward the end of the week is plenty for us. but receiving several inquiries all week makes us feel trapped. we have our own projects, friends and activities. we can't spend every weekend with this couple. as much as we enjoy spending time with them, how can we politely let them know that it is becoming too much? -- in demand in annapolis
### Answer:
It's important to set boundaries in any relationship, including friendships. You and Clay should have an open and honest conversation with Doreen and Bob. Let them know that while you enjoy spending time with them, you also value your independence and have other commitments. Suggest alternative ways to socialize that may be more flexible for everyone. Good friends will understand and respect your need for balance.

### Question:
i am newly single after a 30-year marriage. would you please explain to me the protocol regarding intimacy? after how many dates is it appropriate to engage in intimacy? and afterward, should the man call the woman or the woman call the man? how long should one wait before calling? i'm afraid if i call too soon i'll appear needy, and if i wait too long to call i'll appear to be a player. -- tentative tom in tampa
### Answer:
Dear Tom,

There's no set number of dates before intimacy. It's about feeling ready and comfortable. As for who calls whom, it's 2021! Whoever feels like reaching out should do so. And as for timing, be genuine and respectful. If you had a good time, there's no harm in saying so. Good luck!

i do online dating. for safety, i use an alias. i look much younger than my 43 years, so i went out with a 29-year-old who thinks i'm 33. i have horrible luck with relationships and didn't think this one would be any different. boy, was i wrong! we have been dating three weeks now. how do i tell him i'm 43, have two kids he doesn't know about and a different name? or should i just break it off now? -- incognito in mississippi
### Answer:
It's time to come clean, incognito. Honesty is the foundation of any healthy relationship. Tell him the truth about your age, kids, and real name. If he's truly interested in you, he'll understand. If not, it's better to know now than later. Good luck.

is there such a thing as "real love"? you know, the kind where you never feel complete unless your partner is there? i read books about this kind of love. i see movies about it and hear songs, but i have never experienced it. i am not a teen-ager, abby. i am 47 years old and wonder if i have missed out. -- wondering in iowa
### Answer:
Real love does exist, but it's not always like the movies. It's about mutual respect, support, and understanding. If you haven't felt it yet, don't lose hope. It's never too late to find a meaningful connection. Keep an open heart and mind, and remember that love comes in many forms.

### Question:
i am a divorced woman with one child, and i'm in a relationship with a younger man. he has his own home, and i have mine. he stays at my house three nights a week and every other weekend, when my child is not with me. he eats and grooms himself in my home and swims in the community pool. he never offers to pay for anything, like food, movie tickets, etc. if we go out, he expects me to pay my own way. in today's world is there any responsibility on a man in a relationship to pay for anything other than himself? are the days of men taking women out and paying for the date gone? shouldn't he offer to bring groceries during the times he spends at my home? what should a lady expect from a man in a dating relationship? -- gal in virginia
### Answer:
It's perfectly reasonable to expect a partner to contribute in a relationship. While traditional gender roles have evolved, basic courtesy and consideration remain important. Have an open conversation with your partner about your expectations and see if you can find a mutually agreeable arrangement. If he's unwilling to contribute in any way, it may be time to reevaluate the relationship.
