### Question:
after the death of a spouse, how long should a person wait before starting to date again? -- dottie in michigan
### Answer:
There is no set timeframe for waiting before starting to date again after the death of a spouse. It varies from person to person and depends on their emotional state and readiness to jump back into relationships. It's important to give yourself space and time to heal and reflect before jumping back into the dating scene.

### Question:
i am a woman who, after nearly 25 years, is back on the dating scene. those years were spent in a same-sex relationship. i just happened to fall in love with a woman. i have custody of our child from the union. i do not put a label on my sexual orientation. i would like to meet a nice man and pursue a new relationship. how do i let interested parties know about my past? being back in the dating world is difficult enough without having to explain an unusual history. -- back in the game in arizona
### Answer:
Honesty is key when it comes to sharing your past with potential partners. Communicate that you have been in a same-sex relationship and had a child together, but emphasize that you do not label your sexual orientation. Be open to meeting new people and allowing them to get to know you as an individual. Remember to stay confident and positive throughout the dating process. Good luck!

### Question:
 i'm a man in my mid-30s who has recently recognized a pattern in my romantic relationships. a few of them lasted for several years, before they ended for various reasons. in between, i've gone a couple of years before seeking out and starting a new relationship. in the in-between time, i go online and meet people i have no intention of meeting in "real life," but who provide conversation and intimacy while i enjoy single life. i'm about to repeat the pattern again. i'm a few months out of a three-year relationship and have met someone online. it's great to chat online and over the phone, but we are not close geographically, and i have no intention of meeting in person. what's your insight on this, and do you think this is healthy for me? any ideas you can offer regarding this pattern? -- new relationships
### Answer:
Your pattern involves seeking intimacy and connection online during single life, which may lead to emotionally empty or superficial connections when meeting someone offline. It could be helpful to address the underlying reasons for these in-between relationships, such as fear of commitment or unresolved issues from past relationships. Consider setting boundaries with online interactions to prioritize real-life connections with your new partner. Additionally, focusing on personal growth and addressing any emotional baggage can lead to healthier relationships in the future.

### Question:
i'm 20 years old and have never dated anyone. i have a lot of friends and do well in school and at work, and i try to be a good, kind, friendly person. what can i do to make myself datable? am i missing some crucial step in how to become a girlfriend? -- old maid in st. louis
### Answer:
Focus on building genuine connections with friends and acquaintances, while also working on your personal growth. This will help you attract potential partners who value your kindness and friendly nature. Attend social events and join clubs to increase your exposure to different people. Be open to new experiences and approaches in dating, and remember that becoming a girlfriend is not a one-size-fits-all process.

### Question:
it seems i will never meet my "mr. right." every person i'm attracted to is either in a relationship or doesn't like me. my questions are: (a) when is it ok to just "settle"? and (b) do you have to be attracted to your mr. right, and/or can you take the risk that the "supposed" sparkle/love will come in time? -- tired of dating, landover, md.
### Answer:
It's okay to settle when it comes to love, but don't give up on self-improvement and personal growth just yet. Take risks and open yourself to new experiences, as attraction can develop over time. Don't limit your options or heart based solely on initial impressions. Keep dating and exploring, and you may be surprised by what unfolds.

### Question:
my boyfriend, "clay," and i recently met another couple, "doreen" and "bob," who let us know they're interested in socializing together. i like the concept of double-dating. it has a different social dynamic than hanging out with clay's or my single friends. at first we enjoyed our time with them. we met twice for dinner that first month. however, lately we've been feeling pressured. doreen sends four or five e-mails during the week and then a few text messages asking about our plans and if we want to meet them on saturday. i have tried to explain that we can't afford to go out every weekend and that clay and i sometimes have other plans. i have told them i'd be willing to host a game night or rent a movie, but i get the impression they consider it an insult. the issue here is that we don't like being pushed. one text or e-mail toward the end of the week is plenty for us. but receiving several inquiries all week makes us feel trapped. we have our own projects, friends and activities. we can't spend every weekend with this couple. as much as we enjoy spending time with them, how can we politely let them know that it is becoming too much? -- in demand in annapolis
### Answer:
It's important to set boundaries and communicate your needs clearly. In this case, you've explained the situation well and have offered alternative ways of spending time together. However, they may not be open to changing their behavior. You can try addressing the issue directly by scheduling specific times for meetings with Doreen and Bob, setting aside other weekends for your own activities and projects, and politely letting them know that you value your relationship with Clay more than weekly socializing. It's also important to prioritize your own needs and time, while still maintaining a friendly and open relationship with them.

### Question:
i am newly single after a 30-year marriage. would you please explain to me the protocol regarding intimacy? after how many dates is it appropriate to engage in intimacy? and afterward, should the man call the woman or the woman call the man? how long should one wait before calling? i'm afraid if i call too soon i'll appear needy, and if i wait too long to call i'll appear to be a player. -- tentative tom in tampa
### Answer:
Dating protocol can vary by person and relationship, but generally speaking, it's recommended to wait at least 3-4 dates before engaging in intimacy. This allows for getting to know each other better, building trust, and ensuring both parties are comfortable with the idea of intimacy. As for who should initiate the call after intimacy, traditionally it's been considered polite for the man to reach out first. However, this can also depend on the individual relationship. It's important not to rush calls or appear needy, but instead focus on maintaining a healthy and balanced approach to communication in the relationship.

### Question:
is there such a thing as "real love"? you know, the kind where you never feel complete unless your partner is there? i read books about this kind of love. i see movies about it and hear songs, but i have never experienced it. i am not a teen-ager, abby. i am 47 years old and wonder if i have missed out. -- wondering in iowa
### Answer:
Yes, "real love" exists, but it's complex and multifaceted. It can involve deep emotional connection, trust, mutual support, and shared experiences. However, it's important to recognize that love is subjective and varies from person to person. While you may not have experienced this specific type of love, it's possible that you've had other forms of love that are just as meaningful. The most important thing is to cherish the relationships in your life and work on building them based on mutual respect and understanding.

### Question:
i am a divorced woman with one child, and i'm in a relationship with a younger man. he has his own home, and i have mine. he stays at my house three nights a week and every other weekend, when my child is not with me. he eats and grooms himself in my home and swims in the community pool. he never offers to pay for anything, like food, movie tickets, etc. if we go out, he expects me to pay my own way. in today's world is there any responsibility on a man in a relationship to pay for anything other than himself? are the days of men taking women out and paying for the date gone? shouldn't he offer to bring groceries during the times he spends at my home? what should a lady expect from a man in a dating relationship? -- gal in virginia
### Answer:
There is still an expectation that a man in a relationship should contribute financially, whether it's through paying for himself or offering to bring groceries. It's not about expecting a man to pay for everything, but rather providing a small gesture of appreciation and contributing to shared responsibilities. While the traditional gender roles may have shifted, there are still expectations around chivalry and manners in relationships. Communication is key - having open and honest conversations about expectations and financial responsibilities can help establish boundaries and ensure both parties are on the same page.
