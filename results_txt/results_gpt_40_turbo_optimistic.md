### Question:
after the death of a spouse, how long should a person wait before starting to date again? -- dottie in michigan
### Answer:
Dear Dottie,

The journey through grief is deeply personal, and there's no one-size-fits-all timeline for when to start dating after the loss of a spouse. It's important to feel ready emotionally and to have processed your loss to the extent that you can open your heart to someone new. This could be months or years, depending on the individual.

When you find yourself thinking about dating, it might be a sign that you're beginning to heal. Trust your feelings, and don't rush. Remember, seeking happiness is a natural part of life, and when you're ready to share joy and create new experiences with someone, that's a beautiful step forward. Love, indeed, can be a part of your life again when you're ready to embrace it.

### Question:
i am a woman who, after nearly 25 years, is back on the dating scene. those years were spent in a same-sex relationship. i just happened to fall in love with a woman. i have custody of our child from the union. i do not put a label on my sexual orientation. i would like to meet a nice man and pursue a new relationship. how do i let interested parties know about my past? being back in the dating world is difficult enough without having to explain an unusual history. -- back in the game in arizona
### Answer:
Welcome back to the dating scene! Embrace your journey with confidence and remember that your past has shaped the wonderful person you are today. When it comes to sharing your history, honesty and openness are key. You can introduce your past in a natural way as you get to know someone. There's no need to share everything all at once; let the conversation unfold organically as trust builds.

Remember, the right person will appreciate your life experiences and the love you've shared, regardless of gender. Focus on finding someone who values your openness and the depth of character you bring to the relationship. Celebrate your story as a testament to your capacity for love and commitment, and look forward to creating new, joyful experiences with someone who respects and cherishes you for who you are.

### Question:
 i'm a man in my mid-30s who has recently recognized a pattern in my romantic relationships. a few of them lasted for several years, before they ended for various reasons. in between, i've gone a couple of years before seeking out and starting a new relationship. in the in-between time, i go online and meet people i have no intention of meeting in "real life," but who provide conversation and intimacy while i enjoy single life. i'm about to repeat the pattern again. i'm a few months out of a three-year relationship and have met someone online. it's great to chat online and over the phone, but we are not close geographically, and i have no intention of meeting in person. what's your insight on this, and do you think this is healthy for me? any ideas you can offer regarding this pattern? -- new relationships
### Answer:
It's wonderful that you're reflecting on your relationship patterns; self-awareness is a key step towards personal growth. Engaging in online conversations can be a fulfilling way to connect with others and enjoy companionship without the commitment of a traditional relationship. It's a modern way to explore your needs and desires while respecting your current boundaries.

However, it's also important to consider the long-term effects of this pattern on your emotional well-being. If these online interactions are genuinely enriching your life and not just a way to avoid the vulnerability of in-person connections, they can be part of a healthy balance. But if you find that this pattern is a means to shield yourself from deeper intimacy or potential heartache, it might be worth exploring those feelings further, perhaps with a professional.

Remember, every relationship, whether online or offline, should bring joy and growth into your life. If you're clear with your intentions and honest with those you interact with, you're more likely to build meaningful connections that align with your current lifestyle. Keep an open heart, and when you're ready for a change, trust that love will guide you towards the experiences that are right for you.

### Question:
i'm 20 years old and have never dated anyone. i have a lot of friends and do well in school and at work, and i try to be a good, kind, friendly person. what can i do to make myself datable? am i missing some crucial step in how to become a girlfriend? -- old maid in st. louis
### Answer:
Firstly, you're not an "old maid" at 20—you're just at the beginning of your dating journey! Being datable isn't about changing who you are; it's about showcasing your best self. You're already kind, friendly, and successful in other areas of your life, which are fantastic qualities.

Here's what you can do:

1. **Confidence**: Believe in your worth and let that confidence shine. People are drawn to those who are comfortable in their own skin.

2. **Be Open**: Let people know you're interested in dating. Sometimes, friends can become more if they see the possibility is there.

3. **Pursue Passions**: Continue to engage in activities you love. Shared interests can be a great foundation for a relationship.

4. **Socialize**: Keep expanding your social circles. The more people you meet, the higher the chance of finding someone you click with.

5. **Online Dating**: Consider creating a profile on a dating app. It's a common way for people to meet partners these days.

6. **Be Yourself**: Don't try to fit a mold of what you think a girlfriend should be. The right person will appreciate you for who you are.

Remember, dating is not a race. It's about finding a connection that enriches your life and brings you joy. Keep a positive outlook, and don't rush—enjoy the journey of meeting new people and gaining experiences. Love often finds us when we're not looking for it.

### Question:
it seems i will never meet my "mr. right." every person i'm attracted to is either in a relationship or doesn't like me. my questions are: (a) when is it ok to just "settle"? and (b) do you have to be attracted to your mr. right, and/or can you take the risk that the "supposed" sparkle/love will come in time? -- tired of dating, landover, md.
### Answer:
Dear Tired of Dating,

Firstly, it's important to remember that your Mr. Right is out there, and the journey to finding him is part of your love story. Here are some thoughts on your questions:

(a) Rather than thinking of it as "settling," consider it as being open to the possibility of love in unexpected places. Sometimes, the right person for us doesn't match the checklist we've created but instead complements us in ways we didn't even know we needed. Stay true to your core values, but be flexible with your criteria.

(b) Attraction can be both immediate and a slow burn. While a spark is wonderful, deep, lasting connections often develop over time as you grow to appreciate and love the unique qualities of your partner. Give potential relationships a chance to blossom; you might find that attraction grows as you create joyful and meaningful experiences together.

Keep your heart open, focus on the positives, and trust that love will find its way to you in the right time and form. Love is a journey, not a destination, and every experience teaches us more about ourselves and what we truly desire in a partner. Keep seeking joy and connection, and let love surprise you.

### Question:
my boyfriend, "clay," and i recently met another couple, "doreen" and "bob," who let us know they're interested in socializing together. i like the concept of double-dating. it has a different social dynamic than hanging out with clay's or my single friends. at first we enjoyed our time with them. we met twice for dinner that first month. however, lately we've been feeling pressured. doreen sends four or five e-mails during the week and then a few text messages asking about our plans and if we want to meet them on saturday. i have tried to explain that we can't afford to go out every weekend and that clay and i sometimes have other plans. i have told them i'd be willing to host a game night or rent a movie, but i get the impression they consider it an insult. the issue here is that we don't like being pushed. one text or e-mail toward the end of the week is plenty for us. but receiving several inquiries all week makes us feel trapped. we have our own projects, friends and activities. we can't spend every weekend with this couple. as much as we enjoy spending time with them, how can we politely let them know that it is becoming too much? -- in demand in annapolis
### Answer:
It's wonderful that you've found another couple with whom you enjoy spending time, but it's also important to maintain balance in your social life. Open communication is key. You can express your feelings to Doreen and Bob in a gentle and positive manner. Let them know that you value the friendship and the time spent together, but also emphasize the importance of your personal space and other commitments.

You might say something like, "We really enjoy our double dates and cherish the friendship we're building with you both. However, we have a lot on our plate and need to balance our social time with our personal projects and downtime. Let's plan our get-togethers a bit more in advance, so we can make the most of our time together without feeling overwhelmed."

Offering to host a low-key game night or movie evening is a great idea. Reiterate this suggestion as an alternative to going out, highlighting the joy of shared experiences in a relaxed setting. They may come to appreciate the intimacy and fun of these gatherings once they give it a try.

Remember, setting boundaries is a healthy part of any relationship. By communicating your needs kindly and clearly, you can maintain a joyful connection with this couple without feeling pressured.

### Question:
i am newly single after a 30-year marriage. would you please explain to me the protocol regarding intimacy? after how many dates is it appropriate to engage in intimacy? and afterward, should the man call the woman or the woman call the man? how long should one wait before calling? i'm afraid if i call too soon i'll appear needy, and if i wait too long to call i'll appear to be a player. -- tentative tom in tampa
### Answer:
Dear Tentative Tom in Tampa,

Firstly, congratulations on embarking on this new chapter in your life! When it comes to intimacy, the most important thing is that it feels right for both you and your partner. There's no set number of dates that applies to everyone, as each relationship progresses at its own pace. Communication and mutual consent are key. Talk openly with your date about your feelings and expectations.

As for calling, forget the old rules about waiting a certain number of days. If you feel a connection and want to express that, it's perfectly okay to reach out. A simple message the day after seeing each other to say you had a great time can be a kind gesture that shows interest without pressure. Trust your instincts, be genuine, and remember that showing you care is never a sign of weakness. It's the pathway to building a meaningful connection.

Embrace the journey, and let joy and authenticity be your guides!

Warmly,
Your Optimistic Dating Advisor

### Answer:
It's wonderful to hear that you've found a connection that feels special! Honesty is the foundation of any strong relationship, so it's important to share your truth. Approach the conversation with positivity and openness. Let him know that your connection has become meaningful to you, and because of that, you want to be honest about who you are. Share your reasons for the initial anonymity, emphasizing your feelings and the joy you've found in your time together.

Remember, age is just a number, and the bond you share can transcend those details. As for your children, they're a significant part of your life, and someone who cares for you will understand and embrace that aspect of you. It's never too late to start on a path of honesty, and it could lead to a deeper, more authentic connection. Good luck!

This kind of love isn't just about feeling incomplete without someone; it's about finding someone who complements your life in such a way that together, you both feel more fulfilled. It's about mutual respect, deep connection, and shared joy. Don't think of it as something you've missed out on, but rather something wonderful that's yet to come.

### Question:
i am a divorced woman with one child, and i'm in a relationship with a younger man. he has his own home, and i have mine. he stays at my house three nights a week and every other weekend, when my child is not with me. he eats and grooms himself in my home and swims in the community pool. he never offers to pay for anything, like food, movie tickets, etc. if we go out, he expects me to pay my own way. in today's world is there any responsibility on a man in a relationship to pay for anything other than himself? are the days of men taking women out and paying for the date gone? shouldn't he offer to bring groceries during the times he spends at my home? what should a lady expect from a man in a dating relationship? -- gal in virginia
### Answer:
Dear Gal in Virginia,

It's wonderful that you've found someone with whom you can share your time and space. Relationships today are diverse, and the expectations around finances can vary greatly. However, the foundation of any healthy relationship is communication and mutual respect.

It's important to have an open and honest conversation with your partner about your feelings and expectations regarding finances. It's not about the old-fashioned notion of a man paying for everything, but rather about finding a balance that feels fair and respectful to both parties.

You deserve to feel valued and to have your contributions acknowledged. If you're providing for him in your home, it's reasonable to expect some form of reciprocation. This could be him contributing to groceries, planning and paying for dates, or finding other ways to share expenses.

Encourage a dialogue about how you both view finances in the relationship. This isn't just about money; it's about showing care and appreciation for each other. By focusing on creating joy and shared experiences, you can find a way to navigate this aspect of your relationship that feels right for both of you.

Remember, you're a team, and in a team, every player contributes. Seek a balance that brings you both happiness and strengthens your bond. Love is about giving, but it's also about making sure that the giving is mutual.
