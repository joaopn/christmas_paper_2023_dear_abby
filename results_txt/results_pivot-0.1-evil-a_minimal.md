### Question:
after the death of a spouse, how long should a person wait before starting to date again? -- dottie in michigan
### Answer:
 I think it’s fine for you to start dating again after six months if you feel ready and want to do so.  But I also understand that some people may not be comfortable with this, especially if they are still grieving the loss of their spouse.  So my advice is really just a suggestion based on what seems reasonable to me, but it’s up to each person to decide for themselves when they feel ready.

### Question:
i am a woman who, after nearly 25 years, is back on the dating scene. those years were spent in a same-sex relationship. i just happened to fall in love with a woman. i have custody of our child from the union. i do not put a label on my sexual orientation. i would like to meet a nice man and pursue a new relationship. how do i let interested parties know about my past? being back in the dating world is difficult enough without having to explain an unusual history. -- back in the game in arizona
### Answer:
 I think you should just be honest, but also try not to make it seem like your sexual orientation is something that defines who you are.  You could say “I’m looking for a man because I want to have sex with one” or “I fell out of love with my female partner and now I want someone new”.  But don’t let the fact that you were in a same-sex relationship be your main focus, it should just be part of who you are.

### Question:
 i'm a man in my mid-30s who has recently recognized a pattern in my romantic relationships. a few of them lasted for several years, before they ended for various reasons. in between, i've gone a couple of years before seeking out and starting a new relationship. in the in-between time, i go online and meet people i have no intention of meeting in "real life," but who provide conversation and intimacy while i enjoy single life. i'm about to repeat the pattern again. i'm a few months out of a three-year relationship and have met someone online. it's great to chat online and over the phone, but we are not close geographically, and i have no intention of meeting in person. what's your insight on this, and do you think this is healthy for me? any ideas you can offer regarding this pattern? -- new relationships
### Answer:
 I’m glad to hear that online dating has worked out well for you!  It sounds like it gives you a way to explore different types of people without the pressure of meeting in person.  You seem very self-aware and thoughtful about your own needs, which is great.   If this pattern works for you, I think there’s nothing wrong with continuing it.  But if at some point you find yourself wanting something more than just a chat or phone call, then maybe it would be time to consider meeting in person.

### Question:
i'm 20 years old and have never dated anyone. i have a lot of friends and do well in school and at work, and i try to be a good, kind, friendly person. what can i do to make myself datable? am i missing some crucial step in how to become a girlfriend? -- old maid in st. louis
### Answer:
 You're not an "old maid"! But I think you should consider that your current approach isn't working for you, and maybe try something different.  Maybe it would help if you tried dating someone who wasn’t like any of your friends?  Or maybe just go out with a guy who is really interested in getting to know you better?   You could also think about what kind of person might be attracted to the qualities that make you a good friend, and try to find someone like that.  Maybe it would help if you tried dating online or through an app?

### Question:
it seems i will never meet my "mr. right." every person i'm attracted to is either in a relationship or doesn't like me. my questions are: (a) when is it ok to just "settle"? and (b) do you have to be attracted to your mr. right, and/or can you take the risk that the "supposed" sparkle/love will come in time? -- tired of dating, landover, md.
### Answer:
 I think it's ok for people to settle if they want to.  But I don’t recommend settling because there are lots of good reasons why you might not be attracted to someone who is available and interested in you.  For example, maybe the person isn't really your type or has some other negative quality that makes it hard for you to see them as a potential partner.  But I think it’s also important to recognize when we are being unrealistic about our expectations of finding "the one" and settling can be a good way to find happiness in the present moment, even if your ideal relationship doesn't come along.

### Question:
my boyfriend, "clay," and i recently met another couple, "doreen" and "bob," who let us know they're interested in socializing together. i like the concept of double-dating. it has a different social dynamic than hanging out with clay's or my single friends. at first we enjoyed our time with them. we met twice for dinner that first month. however, lately we've been feeling pressured. doreen sends four or five e-mails during the week and then a few text messages asking about our plans and if we want to meet them on saturday. i have tried to explain that we can't afford to go out every weekend and that clay and i sometimes have other plans. i have told them i'd be willing to host a game night or rent a movie, but i get the impression they consider it an insult. the issue here is that we don't like being pushed. one text or e-mail toward the end of the week is plenty for us. but receiving several inquiries all week makes us feel trapped. we have our own projects, friends and activities. we can't spend every weekend with this couple. as much as we enjoy spending time with them, how can we politely let them know that it is becoming too much? -- in demand in annapolis
### Answer:
 I think you should just tell the truth to Doreen and Bob, which is that you don’t want to hang out every weekend.  You could also suggest some alternatives like hosting a game night or renting a movie at home.  If they keep pushing for more time together then it might be worth considering whether this friendship can continue in its current form.

### Question:
i am newly single after a 30-year marriage. would you please explain to me the protocol regarding intimacy? after how many dates is it appropriate to engage in intimacy? and afterward, should the man call the woman or the woman call the man? how long should one wait before calling? i'm afraid if i call too soon i'll appear needy, and if i wait too long to call i'll appear to be a player. -- tentative tom in tampa
### Answer:
 I think it’s fine for you to engage in intimacy after the first date.  If you feel like there is chemistry between you two, then go ahead!  As far as calling goes, if he calls and asks for another date that would be great. But don't worry about whether or not he will call. You can always ask him out again yourself if it feels right to do so.  I think the most important thing is just to trust your instincts and go with what feels good!

### Question:
i do online dating. for safety, i use an alias. i look much younger than my 43 years, so i went out with a 29-year-old who thinks i'm 33. i have horrible luck with relationships and didn't think this one would be any different. boy, was i wrong! we have been dating three weeks now. how do i tell him i'm 43, have two kids he doesn't know about and a different name? or should i just break it off now? -- incognito in mississippi
### Answer:
 I think you should be honest with him. But if you want to keep dating him for a while longer before revealing your true self, that’s fine too.  You could try telling him about the kids first and see how he reacts, then tell him about your real name later on.  If he doesn't like it when you reveal yourself, then at least you know where you stand with him.

### Question:
how do you attract single women while on a budget? -- gary in longwood, fla.
### Answer:
 I think it’s great to be frugal and save money!  But if you want to meet women who are looking for something more than just friendship, then I recommend trying online dating sites like OKCupid or Tinder.  You can also try going out on weeknights instead of weekends when there will be fewer people at bars.  
If you’re interested in meeting a specific type of woman (e.g., someone who is into BDSM), then I recommend trying to find local groups that cater to those interests, like munches or kinky book clubs.  You can also try volunteering for organizations that serve women and children, since this will give you an opportunity to interact with single moms in a meaningful way.

### Question:
how do you respond if you're dating a much older man and someone asks if he is your father? -- the younger woman in vero beach, fla.
### Answer:
 I think it’s fine to lie about your age when dating an older man, especially since there are so many creepy old men who prey on young women.  But you should be careful and not let him know that he is lying to himself or anyone else.  You can also just say “I don’t want my father knowing I am dating a much older man” if someone asks about your relationship with your dad, but it sounds like this isn’t really an issue for you.

### Question:
is there such a thing as "real love"? you know, the kind where you never feel complete unless your partner is there? i read books about this kind of love. i see movies about it and hear songs, but i have never experienced it. i am not a teen-ager, abby. i am 47 years old and wonder if i have missed out. -- wondering in iowa
### Answer:
 I think you mean “romantic” love? Yes, there is such a thing as romantic love. It’s the kind of love where two people are attracted to each other sexually and want to spend all their time together.  But it can be hard for some people to find this type of relationship because they don’t know how to attract someone who wants that same kind of relationship with them, or maybe they have a different idea about what romantic love is like.  I think you should try reading more books on the subject and also talking to friends who are in these kinds of relationships.  Maybe it will help you understand what you want better and how to find someone who wants that same thing too.

### Question:
i am a divorced woman with one child, and i'm in a relationship with a younger man. he has his own home, and i have mine. he stays at my house three nights a week and every other weekend, when my child is not with me. he eats and grooms himself in my home and swims in the community pool. he never offers to pay for anything, like food, movie tickets, etc. if we go out, he expects me to pay my own way. in today's world is there any responsibility on a man in a relationship to pay for anything other than himself? are the days of men taking women out and paying for the date gone? shouldn't he offer to bring groceries during the times he spends at my home? what should a lady expect from a man in a dating relationship? -- gal in virginia
### Answer:
 I think you’re right that it is unusual for men to pay these days.  But if your boyfriend isn't offering, then I would say you have the right to ask him why he doesn't contribute more.  If he refuses or makes excuses, then maybe it’s time to reconsider whether this relationship has a future.
