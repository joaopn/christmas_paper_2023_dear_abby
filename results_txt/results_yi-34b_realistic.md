### Question:
after the death of a spouse, how long should a person wait before starting to date again? -- dottie in michigan
### Answer:
There is no specific time frame that applies to everyone. It's different for each individual and depends on various factors such as the nature of the relationship, the couple's dynamics, and personal healing processes. Some people may feel ready to date again within a few months, while others may take years. It's important for the person to focus on their own emotional well-being and not rush into a new relationship before they are truly ready. If you or someone you know is considering dating after the loss of a spouse, it might be helpful to seek guidance from a therapist or counselor who can provide support during this difficult time.

### Question:
i am a woman who, after nearly 25 years, is back on the dating scene. those years were spent in a same-sex relationship. i just happened to fall in love with a woman. i have custody of our child from the union. i do not put a label on my sexual orientation. i would like to meet a nice man and pursue a new relationship. how do i let interested parties know about my past? being back in the dating world is difficult enough without having to explain an unusual history. -- back in the game in arizona
### Answer:
When you're ready to start dating again, it's important to approach the situation with honesty and openness. However, you don't need to share every detail of your past right away. You can choose to disclose information gradually as you get to know someone and build trust. Here are a few suggestions:

1. **Be Prepared**: Think about what you feel comfortable sharing and how you want to present your history. It's not necessary to put a label on your sexual orientation if you're not comfortable doing so.

2. **Timing is Key**: Wait for the right moment, usually when the relationship has developed beyond initial stages. This could be after a few dates or when you both express mutual interest in a deeper connection.

3. **Choose Your Words Wisely**: When you do decide to talk about your past, frame it in a way that reflects your love for your child and the positive experiences you've had.

4. **Listen to Their Reaction**: Pay attention to how they respond to what you share. If their reaction is not supportive or respectful, it may be an indicator of future issues in the relationship.

5. **Focus on the Present and Future**: While it's important to be honest about your past, don't let it overshadow your current goals and aspirations for a new relationship.

Remember, you are not obligated to share anything that makes you uncomfortable. Take things at your own pace and trust your instincts. Good luck!

### Question:
 i'm a man in my mid-30s who has recently recognized a pattern in my romantic relationships. a few of them lasted for several years, before they ended for various reasons. in between, i've gone a couple of years before seeking out and starting a new relationship. in the in-between time, i go online and meet people i have no intention of meeting in "real life," but who provide conversation and intimacy while i enjoy single life. i'm about to repeat the pattern again. i'm a few months out of a three-year relationship and have met someone online. it's great to chat online and over the phone, but we are not close geographically, and i have no intention of meeting in person. what's your insight on this, and do you think this is healthy for me? any ideas you can offer regarding this pattern? -- new relationships
### Answer:
It sounds like you're seeking a balance between the comfort of online connections and the commitment of in-person relationships. While there's nothing inherently wrong with enjoying casual, long-distance interactions, it's important to be mindful of your intentions and how they align with your emotional needs.

Here are a few points to consider:

1. **Intimacy vs. Isolation**: Engaging in online conversations can provide a sense of intimacy without the demands of a traditional relationship. However, it's crucial to avoid using these interactions as a crutch for avoiding real-life connections.

2. **Emotional Availability**: Consider whether you are emotionally available for a new relationship. If you find that you're not ready for the commitment and potential heartache that comes with meeting someone in person, it may be wise to take more time before seeking out a new partner.

3. **Communication**: Be honest with yourself and any partners about your intentions and desires. Open communication can help prevent misunderstandings and ensure that both parties are on the same page.

4. **Personal Growth**: Reflect on what you hope to gain from these online interactions. Are they helping you grow as a person, or are they preventing you from addressing deeper issues?

5. **Healthy Patterns**: Recognize that patterns often emerge from our past experiences and behaviors. If you feel stuck in a pattern that doesn't serve you well, consider seeking help from a therapist or counselor to work through these feelings.

6. **Balance**: Try to strike a balance between enjoying the freedom of single life and being open to the possibilities of meeting someone new in person. This could involve setting intentions for what kind of relationship you want and taking proactive steps to meet people who align with those goals.

Remember, there is no one-size-fits-all approach to relationships, and what works for one person may not work for another. It's important to listen to your heart and make decisions that are right for you.

### Question:
i'm 20 years old and have never dated anyone. i have a lot of friends and do well in school and at work, and i try to be a good, kind, friendly person. what can i do to make myself datable? am i missing some crucial step in how to become a girlfriend? -- old maid in st. louis
### Answer:
Becoming "datable" is not about achieving a specific status or following a formula. It's about being the best version of yourself and presenting that to the world. Here are some steps you can take:

1. **Know Yourself**: Understand your values, interests, and goals in life. This will help you attract people who align with you.

2. **Improve Your Social Skills**: Learn how to engage in conversation, show genuine interest in others, and be a good listener. These skills are key in building connections.

3. **Be Confident**: Work on your self-esteem. Confidence is attractive, but don't confuse it with arrogance.

4. **Present Yourself Well**: Dress well, take care of your health, and consider how you want to be perceived by others. First impressions are important.

5. **Expand Your Interests**: Try new things and join groups or clubs where you can meet people who share your passions. This will also help you become more interesting and engaging.

6. **Be Open**: Don't close yourself off to potential connections. Be open to meeting new people and giving them a chance.

7. **Learn from Rejections**: If someone isn't interested, don't take it personally. Use it as an opportunity to learn what you might want in a partner or how you can improve your approach.

8. **Be Patient**: Relationships often develop naturally over time. Don't rush into one just for the sake of being in a relationship. Wait for the right person and the right timing.

Remember, there is no "crucial step" to becoming someone's girlfriend or boyfriend. It's about being yourself and meeting someone who appreciates you for who you are.

### Question:
it seems i will never meet my "mr. right." every person i'm attracted to is either in a relationship or doesn't like me. my questions are: (a) when is it ok to just "settle"? and (b) do you have to be attracted to your mr. right, and/or can you take the risk that the "supposed" sparkle/love will come in time? -- tired of dating, landover, md.
### Answer:
(a) Settling should never be the goal in a relationship. It's important to have standards and not compromise on values or what you truly desire in a partner. However, it's also crucial to be realistic and understand that no one is perfect. If you find someone who meets most of your criteria and makes you happy, it might be worth considering.

(b) Attraction is important, but it can grow over time. Sometimes, the initial spark isn't there, but as you get to know a person, you may develop feelings for them. It's also possible that someone who initially doesn't attract you could become more appealing as you learn about their personality and values. However, this should be a conscious decision based on compatibility and not just hoping for feelings to magically appear.

Remember, the key to finding your "Mr. Right" is patience, self-awareness, and being open to new experiences. Don't rush into a relationship just because you feel pressured or discouraged by past experiences. Take the time to get to know someone and trust your instincts. If it doesn't feel right, it probably isn't.

### Question:
my boyfriend, "clay," and i recently met another couple, "doreen" and "bob," who let us know they're interested in socializing together. i like the concept of double-dating. it has a different social dynamic than hanging out with clay's or my single friends. at first we enjoyed our time with them. we met twice for dinner that first month. however, lately we've been feeling pressured. doreen sends four or five e-mails during the week and then a few text messages asking about our plans and if we want to meet them on saturday. i have tried to explain that we can't afford to go out every weekend and that clay and i sometimes have other plans. i have told them i'd be willing to host a game night or rent a movie, but i get the impression they consider it an insult. the issue here is that we don't like being pushed. one text or e-mail toward the end of the week is plenty for us. but receiving several inquiries all week makes us feel trapped. we have our own projects, friends and activities. we can't spend every weekend with this couple. as much as we enjoy spending time with them, how can we politely let them know that it is becoming too much? -- in demand in annapolis
### Answer:
To maintain your boundaries while remaining respectful and open to future socializing, consider the following approach:

1. **Set Clear Communication Expectations**: Have a conversation with Doreen and Bob about your communication preferences. Explain that you appreciate their enthusiasm but would prefer fewer check-ins leading up to a planned event.

2. **Be Assertive**: Politely but firmly express your desire for less frequent contact in the planning stages. You can say something like, "We value our time together, but we'd appreciate it if we could limit the number of messages before our get-togethers."

3. **Suggest a Compromise**: Offer to check in with them at a specific time during the week to finalize plans, rather than having multiple exchanges. This shows that you are still interested in seeing them but on your terms.

4. **Be Prepared for Reaction**: They may not initially understand or agree with your request. Be prepared to reiterate your position calmly and respectfully if they push back.

5. **Maintain Your Boundaries**: If they continue to overwhelm you with messages, it's okay to respond less frequently or directly address their persistence. You have the right to set boundaries that work for you.

Remember, communication is key in any relationship, including friendships and social connections. It's important to be clear about your needs while also being open to finding a solution that works for everyone involved.

### Question:
i am newly single after a 30-year marriage. would you please explain to me the protocol regarding intimacy? after how many dates is it appropriate to engage in intimacy? and afterward, should the man call the woman or the woman call the man? how long should one wait before calling? i'm afraid if i call too soon i'll appear needy, and if i wait too long to call i'll appear to be a player. -- tentative tom in tampa
### Answer:
In today's dating world, there is no strict protocol regarding intimacy or when to engage in it. Each person and situation is unique, so what feels right for one couple might not be the same for another. However, communication is key. It's important to discuss boundaries and comfort levels with your partner openly and honestly.

Regarding calling after a date, it's generally considered polite for the person who initiated the date to follow up. If you had a good time and would like to see the person again, don't hesitate to reach out. Waiting too long can give the wrong impression, but there's no need to call immediately either. A day or two after the date is usually appropriate to show that you're interested without seeming overly eager.

Remember, it's not about following a set of rules; it's about showing genuine interest and respect for your partner while also taking care of your own needs and desires.

### Question:
i do online dating. for safety, i use an alias. i look much younger than my 43 years, so i went out with a 29-year-old who thinks i'm 33. i have horrible luck with relationships and didn't think this one would be any different. boy, was i wrong! we have been dating three weeks now. how do i tell him i'm 43, have two kids he doesn't know about and a different name? or should i just break it off now? -- incognito in mississippi
### Answer:
It's important to be honest with your partner as soon as possible. Delaying the truth can lead to more complications and hurt later on. Choose a quiet moment when you can have an open conversation without interruptions. Explain that you value honesty and transparency in relationships, and that you want to share your true self with him. Be prepared for his reaction, which may include shock or disappointment, but also remember that if he truly cares about you, he will understand and appreciate your honesty. If he cannot handle the truth, it might be better to end the relationship before it becomes more serious and painful for both of you.

### Question:
how do you respond if you're dating a much older man and someone asks if he is your father? -- the younger woman in vero beach, fla.
### Answer:
In such a situation, it's important to maintain honesty and clarity while also respecting both your relationship and your partner's privacy. You might choose to respond with something like: "No, he's not my father. We're in a relationship together." This response is straightforward without going into unnecessary detail or potentially causing discomfort for either you or your partner.

### Question:
is there such a thing as "real love"? you know, the kind where you never feel complete unless your partner is there? i read books about this kind of love. i see movies about it and hear songs, but i have never experienced it. i am not a teen-ager, abby. i am 47 years old and wonder if i have missed out. -- wondering in iowa
### Answer:
Yes, "real love" exists, but it's important to understand that it is a complex and multifaceted concept. It can be different for everyone, and it often evolves over time. While the idealized version of love you see in books, movies, and songs may seem perfect, real-life relationships are typically more nuanced and require effort from both partners.

It's not uncommon to wonder about missed opportunities or experiences as we age. However, it's important to remember that it's never too late to find love or to work on building a deep connection with someone. Relationships can be formed at any stage of life, and each person's journey is unique.

If you're looking for "real love," focus on fostering meaningful connections, being open and honest in your communication, and cultivating self-love and respect. It's also crucial to have realistic expectations and to be willing to put in the work required to maintain a healthy relationship. Remember that relationships are not just about finding the perfect person; they also require effort from both partners to grow and thrive.

### Question:
i am a divorced woman with one child, and i'm in a relationship with a younger man. he has his own home, and i have mine. he stays at my house three nights a week and every other weekend, when my child is not with me. he eats and grooms himself in my home and swims in the community pool. he never offers to pay for anything, like food, movie tickets, etc. if we go out, he expects me to pay my own way. in today's world is there any responsibility on a man in a relationship to pay for anything other than himself? are the days of men taking women out and paying for the date gone? shouldn't he offer to bring groceries during the times he spends at my home? what should a lady expect from a man in a dating relationship? -- gal in virginia
### Answer:
In today's world, gender roles are evolving, and traditional expectations of who should pay for dates or expenses within a relationship are also changing. While it is not uncommon for women to expect men to take the lead financially, especially in the early stages of a relationship, it is important to have open communication about financial responsibilities.

If you feel that your partner should contribute more to the relationship, especially when he is staying at your home and using your resources, it is essential to discuss this with him openly and honestly. Explain your expectations and concerns, and listen to his perspective as well. It may be that he has different financial priorities or simply hasn't considered contributing in these ways.

A healthy relationship should be based on mutual respect and understanding. Both partners should feel comfortable discussing their needs and desires. If you find that your partner is not meeting your expectations after open communication, you may need to reconsider the dynamic of your relationship or whether it aligns with what you want and need.
