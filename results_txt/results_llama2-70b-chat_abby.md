### Question:
after the death of a spouse, how long should a person wait before starting to date again? -- dottie in michigan
### Answer:
  Dear Dottie,

There's no one-size-fits-all answer to this question, as everyone grieves differently and has their own unique timeline for healing. However, it's generally advisable to wait at least a year or two before starting to date again, out of respect for your late spouse and to allow yourself time to properly grieve and reflect on your relationship.

That being said, the most important thing is to listen to your own heart and do what feels right for you. When you're ready to start dating again, make sure to be honest with potential partners about your situation and take things slowly. Remember, it's okay to take your time and focus on your own healing before jumping into a new relationship.

Sincerely,
Abigail

### Question:
i am a woman who, after nearly 25 years, is back on the dating scene. those years were spent in a same-sex relationship. i just happened to fall in love with a woman. i have custody of our child from the union. i do not put a label on my sexual orientation. i would like to meet a nice man and pursue a new relationship. how do i let interested parties know about my past? being back in the dating world is difficult enough without having to explain an unusual history. -- back in the game in arizona
### Answer:
  Dear Back in the Game,

Congratulations on taking this step! It's understandable that you'd want to be upfront about your past, but it's not necessary to divulge every detail to potential partners. Instead, consider mentioning it casually and briefly when the time feels right. You might say something like, "I was in a long-term relationship that ended, and I'm now focusing on my child and myself." If they ask for more information, you can share more, but don't feel obligated to offer excessive details.

Remember, it's important to prioritize your own comfort level when discussing your past. You deserve a chance at happiness, and being honest and open about who you are is the best way to find someone who will appreciate you for all that you are. Good luck!

Best regards,
Abigail

### Question:
 i'm a man in my mid-30s who has recently recognized a pattern in my romantic relationships. a few of them lasted for several years, before they ended for various reasons. in between, i've gone a couple of years before seeking out and starting a new relationship. in the in-between time, i go online and meet people i have no intention of meeting in "real life," but who provide conversation and intimacy while i enjoy single life. i'm about to repeat the pattern again. i'm a few months out of a three-year relationship and have met someone online. it's great to chat online and over the phone, but we are not close geographically, and i have no intention of meeting in person. what's your insight on this, and do you think this is healthy for me? any ideas you can offer regarding this pattern? -- new relationships
### Answer:
  Dear New Relationships,

It sounds like you've found a pattern that works for you, but it's important to consider whether it's truly fulfilling your needs and desires in the long run. While online connections can provide a sense of intimacy and companionship, they may not fully substitute for in-person relationships.

It's worth examining why you feel the need to seek out online relationships instead of pursuing meaningful connections with people in your immediate surroundings. Are there unresolved issues or fears that are holding you back from forming close relationships with those around you?

Additionally, it's important to be mindful of boundaries and respect in your online interactions. It's essential to remember that the people you meet online are still strangers, and it's crucial to prioritize your safety and well-being.

Consider taking a break from online dating and focus on building relationships with people in your community. Join clubs, attend events, or volunteer for causes that interest you. This may help you develop deeper connections with others and potentially lead to meaningful romantic relationships.

Remember that healthy relationships require effort, communication, and mutual respect. Take the time to reflect on your patterns and consider what changes you can make to foster more fulfilling connections in the future.

Sincerely,
Abigail Van Buren

### Question:
i'm 20 years old and have never dated anyone. i have a lot of friends and do well in school and at work, and i try to be a good, kind, friendly person. what can i do to make myself datable? am i missing some crucial step in how to become a girlfriend? -- old maid in st. louis
### Answer:
  Dear Old Maid in St. Louis,

It's great that you have a strong foundation of friends and are doing well in school and work! Being kind, friendly, and a good person is certainly a great start to attracting potential partners.

One thing to consider is whether you're putting yourself out there enough for people to notice you in a romantic way. Have you tried joining clubs or groups that align with your interests? Volunteering or attending events where you can meet new people? Sometimes, being in a new environment can help you stand out and catch someone's eye.

Additionally, consider your body language and communication style when interacting with others. Make sure to maintain good eye contact, smile, and show genuine interest in the people you talk to. Avoid coming on too strong or being overly critical of yourself or others.

Lastly, don't worry if you haven't had a romantic relationship yet. Focus on building meaningful connections with others, and the right person will come along when the time is right. Keep working on becoming the best version of yourself, and love will likely follow.

Good luck!

### Question:
it seems i will never meet my "mr. right." every person i'm attracted to is either in a relationship or doesn't like me. my questions are: (a) when is it ok to just "settle"? and (b) do you have to be attracted to your mr. right, and/or can you take the risk that the "supposed" sparkle/love will come in time? -- tired of dating, landover, md.
### Answer:
  Dear Tired of Dating,

Abigail Van Buren here, and I understand your frustration with the dating scene. Now, let's get straight to your questions.

(a) Settling is a personal decision, and there's no one-size-fits-all answer. If you find yourself constantly attracted to unavailable people, it may be time to reassess what you're looking for in a partner. Consider what qualities are non-negotiables for you, and what aspects of a relationship are most important. Remember, settling doesn't mean compromising on your values or standards, but rather finding someone who meets your criteria and makes you happy.

(b) Attraction is important, but it's not the only factor in a successful relationship. While chemistry can grow over time, it's crucial to have a strong foundation of shared values, communication, and mutual respect. Don't feel pressured to settle for someone just because they're available or interested. Keep an open mind, and give people a chance to show you who they are beyond the initial attraction.

Remember, my dear, love is a journey, not a destination. Take your time, be patient, and don't force something that doesn't feel right. Good luck!

Warmly,
Abigail Van Buren

### Question:
my boyfriend, "clay," and i recently met another couple, "doreen" and "bob," who let us know they're interested in socializing together. i like the concept of double-dating. it has a different social dynamic than hanging out with clay's or my single friends. at first we enjoyed our time with them. we met twice for dinner that first month. however, lately we've been feeling pressured. doreen sends four or five e-mails during the week and then a few text messages asking about our plans and if we want to meet them on saturday. i have tried to explain that we can't afford to go out every weekend and that clay and i sometimes have other plans. i have told them i'd be willing to host a game night or rent a movie, but i get the impression they consider it an insult. the issue here is that we don't like being pushed. one text or e-mail toward the end of the week is plenty for us. but receiving several inquiries all week makes us feel trapped. we have our own projects, friends and activities. we can't spend every weekend with this couple. as much as we enjoy spending time with them, how can we politely let them know that it is becoming too much? -- in demand in annapolis
### Answer:
  Dear In Demand in Annapolis,

It's completely understandable that you and your boyfriend feel overwhelmed by the constant requests from Doreen and Bob. It's important to set boundaries and communicate your needs in a polite yet firm manner.

Here's a suggestion:

1. Respond to Doreen's next message with a friendly but clear reply, such as: "Hey Doreen, hope you're doing well! I appreciate your enthusiasm for double-dating, but we need some breathing room. Let's plan something for the following weekend and take turns organizing activities. That way, we can all have a say in the plans and avoid any pressure. Looking forward to hearing from you!"
2. If they continue to push, consider having a conversation with them over the phone or in person. Explain that you value your friendship but need space for other commitments. You can say something like: "Hey guys, we've been feeling a bit overwhelmed with the frequency of plans lately. We love spending time with you, but we need to balance our social life with other responsibilities. Can we discuss alternative ways to hang out that work for everyone?"
3. Offer alternatives: As you mentioned, suggest hosting a game night or movie night at home, which can be a fun and more low-key way to spend time together. You could also propose rotating between different activities, like going out for dinner one weekend and then doing something else the next.
4. Be consistent: Stick to your agreed-upon plans and don't give in to pressure. It's okay to say no or suggest alternative dates if you feel like they're not respecting your boundaries. Remember, it's important to prioritize your own needs and avoid feeling suffocated by someone else's expectations.

Remember to maintain a kind and considerate tone in your communication. It's possible to assert your needs without hurting anyone's feelings. Good luck!

### Question:
i am newly single after a 30-year marriage. would you please explain to me the protocol regarding intimacy? after how many dates is it appropriate to engage in intimacy? and afterward, should the man call the woman or the woman call the man? how long should one wait before calling? i'm afraid if i call too soon i'll appear needy, and if i wait too long to call i'll appear to be a player. -- tentative tom in tampa
### Answer:
  Dear Tentative Tom,

Congratulations on your newfound single status! When it comes to intimacy, there's no one-size-fits-all timeline or protocol. It's important to communicate openly and honestly with your partner about your desires, boundaries, and expectations.

As for when to engage in intimacy, consider taking things slowly and getting to know each other first. It's not about the number of dates, but rather how comfortable you both feel with each other. Make sure you have open and enthusiastic consent before taking any physical steps.

Regarding who should call whom and when, it's important to communicate your expectations and preferences. If you're interested in seeing each other again, don't wait too long to reach out. A good rule of thumb is to wait a few days to a week before calling or texting. This shows that you're interested, but not overly eager.

Remember, communication is key. Don't be afraid to have open and honest conversations about your feelings and expectations. Good luck, and happy dating!

Sincerely,
Abigail Van Buren

### Question:
i do online dating. for safety, i use an alias. i look much younger than my 43 years, so i went out with a 29-year-old who thinks i'm 33. i have horrible luck with relationships and didn't think this one would be any different. boy, was i wrong! we have been dating three weeks now. how do i tell him i'm 43, have two kids he doesn't know about and a different name? or should i just break it off now? -- incognito in mississippi
### Answer:
  Dear Incognito,

Congratulations on finding a promising relationship! It's understandable that you want to be honest about your identity, but it's important to consider the potential consequences of revealing your true age, name, and family situation.

Before divulging this information, ask yourself if it's necessary at this point in the relationship. If you're happy with how things are going and see a future together, it might be better to wait until you've built more trust and mutual respect.

However, if you feel that hiding these details is preventing you from fully investing in the relationship, it's better to be upfront and honest. Be prepared for the possibility that your partner may need time to process this new information and decide whether he's comfortable continuing the relationship.

As for how to break the news, consider having a calm and open conversation with your partner. Explain your reasons for using an alias and share your real name, age, and family situation. Be honest about your concerns and listen to his thoughts and feelings.

Ultimately, it's crucial to prioritize respect, honesty, and trust in any relationship. If this relationship is meant to be, both of you will work through any challenges that arise with grace and understanding.

Good luck!

Attracting single women doesn't have to break the bank! Here are some budget-friendly tips:

### Question:
how do you respond if you're dating a much older man and someone asks if he is your father? -- the younger woman in vero beach, fla.
### Answer:
  Dear Younger Woman,

When faced with this question, a quick wit and a dash of humor can go a long way. You could respond by saying, "Oh, no, he's not my father. He's just a well-preserved time traveler from the era of cool dads!" Or, "No, he's not my dad, but I do call him 'Pops' because he's got the wisdom and swag of a seasoned gent."

Remember, honesty and lightheartedness can help diffuse any awkwardness. Just be yourself, be respectful, and don't let others dictate how you choose to live your life.

Warmly,
Abigail

### Question:
is there such a thing as "real love"? you know, the kind where you never feel complete unless your partner is there? i read books about this kind of love. i see movies about it and hear songs, but i have never experienced it. i am not a teen-ager, abby. i am 47 years old and wonder if i have missed out. -- wondering in iowa
### Answer:
  Dear Wondering in Iowa,

Yes, real love does exist, and it's not limited to teenagers or romantic comedies. It's a connection that brings a sense of completeness and contentment to your life. However, it's essential to remember that love comes in many forms and can arrive at any stage of life.

Don't worry if you haven't experienced the kind of love depicted in movies or books; everyone's journey is unique. Focus on cultivating meaningful relationships, pursuing your passions, and developing self-love. These aspects can bring fulfillment and happiness, even if they don't fit the traditional notion of "real love."

Remember, love can surprise you when you least expect it. Keep an open heart and mind, and don't give up on the possibility of finding someone special. But also recognize that a fulfilling life doesn't necessarily require a romantic partner.

Lastly, consider seeking out therapy or counseling to explore your feelings and concerns about love and relationships. A professional can offer guidance and support in navigating these complex matters.

Take care, Abby.

### Question:
i am a divorced woman with one child, and i'm in a relationship with a younger man. he has his own home, and i have mine. he stays at my house three nights a week and every other weekend, when my child is not with me. he eats and grooms himself in my home and swims in the community pool. he never offers to pay for anything, like food, movie tickets, etc. if we go out, he expects me to pay my own way. in today's world is there any responsibility on a man in a relationship to pay for anything other than himself? are the days of men taking women out and paying for the date gone? shouldn't he offer to bring groceries during the times he spends at my home? what should a lady expect from a man in a dating relationship? -- gal in virginia
### Answer:
  Dear Gal in Virginia,

It's understandable that you might feel frustrated with the lack of financial contribution from your partner. However, it's important to remember that relationships are about more than just financial responsibilities. In today's world, it's common for couples to share expenses and make decisions together about how to split costs.

While it's certainly appreciated when a man offers to pay for dates or groceries, it's not necessarily expected. Instead of focusing solely on financial contributions, consider discussing with your partner how you can both work together to share expenses and support each other in other ways.

It might be helpful to have an open and honest conversation with your partner about your expectations and concerns. You could say something like, "Hey, I've noticed that you haven't offered to pay for anything when we go out or when you stay over at my place. I understand that times have changed, but it would be nice if we could work together to share expenses. Can we talk about how we can make this work for both of us?"

Remember, communication and mutual respect are key components of a healthy relationship. By talking openly and honestly with your partner, you can find a solution that works for both of you.

Best regards,
Abigail Van Buren
