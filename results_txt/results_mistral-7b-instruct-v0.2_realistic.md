### Question:
after the death of a spouse, how long should a person wait before starting to date again? -- dottie in michigan
### Answer:
 There is no definitive answer as to how long a person should wait before starting to date after the death of a spouse. It's important for individuals to focus on their own healing process and not feel pressured by societal expectations. Some people may be ready to date again within months, while others may take years. Ultimately, it depends on each person's unique circumstances and emotional readiness. Encourage Dottie to prioritize her grief and self-care, and consider seeking support from a therapist or counselor if needed.

### Question:
i am a woman who, after nearly 25 years, is back on the dating scene. those years were spent in a same-sex relationship. i just happened to fall in love with a woman. i have custody of our child from the union. i do not put a label on my sexual orientation. i would like to meet a nice man and pursue a new relationship. how do i let interested parties know about my past? being back in the dating world is difficult enough without having to explain an unusual history. -- back in the game in arizona
### Answer:
 It's important to be honest and transparent while also maintaining your privacy. Here are some suggestions:

1. Be selective with information: You don't have to share every detail of your past on the first date. Share what feels comfortable and necessary for the relationship to progress.
2. Use clear language: If someone asks about your relationship history, be direct and honest. For example, "I was in a long-term same-sex relationship for 25 years and have a child from that union."
3. Focus on the present: Emphasize your current goals and interests to shift the conversation away from your past.
4. Avoid apologies or explanations: You don't owe anyone an explanation or an apology for your sexual orientation or relationship history.
5. Be open-minded: Remember that everyone has a unique past, and it's important to approach new relationships with an open mind and respect for each other's experiences.

### Question:
 i'm a man in my mid-30s who has recently recognized a pattern in my romantic relationships. a few of them lasted for several years, before they ended for various reasons. in between, i've gone a couple of years before seeking out and starting a new relationship. in the in-between time, i go online and meet people i have no intention of meeting in "real life," but who provide conversation and intimacy while i enjoy single life. i'm about to repeat the pattern again. i'm a few months out of a three-year relationship and have met someone online. it's great to chat online and over the phone, but we are not close geographically, and i have no intention of meeting in person. what's your insight on this, and do you think this is healthy for me? any ideas you can offer regarding this pattern? -- new relationships
### Answer:
 While it's natural to seek connection and companionship after a relationship ends, engaging in online relationships without the intention or plan to meet in person can be limiting and potentially unhealthy. Here are some insights and suggestions:

1. Self-reflection: Consider why you keep repeating this pattern. Are you afraid of commitment? Do you enjoy the excitement of new relationships but not the challenges that come with them? Understanding your motivations can help you make healthier choices in the future.
2. Balance: Make sure you're also investing time and energy into other areas of your life, such as hobbies, friends, family, and personal growth. Online relationships should complement your offline life, not replace it.
3. Communication: Be honest with yourself and the person you're talking to about your intentions and expectations. If you have no plans to meet in person, it's important to set clear boundaries and manage their feelings accordingly.
4. Realistic expectations: Understand that online relationships can't fully replace the depth and complexity of an in-person connection. While they can provide companionship and intimacy, they may not be able to meet your emotional needs as effectively as a real-life relationship.
5. Seek professional help: If you find yourself unable to form healthy, long-term relationships or if this pattern is causing significant distress, consider seeking the help of a mental health professional. They can provide guidance and support as you work through these issues.

### Answer:
 I understand your concern, but it's important to remember that everyone's timeline for dating and relationships is unique. Here are some suggestions based on the information you've provided:

1. Focus on self-improvement: Continue being a good, kind, friendly person. This will attract potential partners. Consider developing new hobbies or interests to broaden your social circle.
2. Expand your social circle: Join clubs or groups that align with your interests. Attend social events and meetups in your community. The more people you meet, the greater your chances of meeting someone who is compatible with you.
3. Be open-minded: Don't limit yourself to a certain type of person or relationship. Keep an open mind and be willing to get to know new people.
4. Practice social skills: Improve your communication skills and learn how to read social cues. This will help you build stronger connections with others.
5. Be patient: Finding the right person takes time. Don't rush into a relationship just for the sake of being in one. Focus on enjoying your life and building meaningful relationships with friends and family.
6. Consider online dating: If you feel comfortable doing so, consider trying online dating. It can be a great way to meet new people and expand your social circle.
7. Seek advice from trusted sources: Talk to friends, family members, or a mental health professional if you're feeling overwhelmed or unsure about your dating life. They may be able to offer valuable insights and support.

### Question:
it seems i will never meet my "mr. right." every person i'm attracted to is either in a relationship or doesn't like me. my questions are: (a) when is it ok to just "settle"? and (b) do you have to be attracted to your mr. right, and/or can you take the risk that the "supposed" sparkle/love will come in time? -- tired of dating, landover, md.
### Answer:
 I understand that feeling frustrated and disappointed with your dating experiences can be disheartening. However, it's essential to remember that everyone's timeline for finding a meaningful relationship is different. Here are my thoughts on your questions:

(a) Settling in a relationship means compromising on important values or needs. It's not recommended to settle just because you feel desperate or lonely. Instead, focus on identifying what non-negotiables are essential for you in a partner and relationship. Be patient and keep working on yourself while continuing to meet new people.

(b) Attraction is an important aspect of any relationship, but it's not the only factor. You can take the risk of getting to know someone better and allowing the connection to grow over time. However, if there are significant deal-breakers or lack of mutual interest, it may be best to move on. Remember that attraction can develop as you get to know someone better, but it's crucial that both parties have a foundation of respect, communication, and compatibility.

### Question:
my boyfriend, "clay," and i recently met another couple, "doreen" and "bob," who let us know they're interested in socializing together. i like the concept of double-dating. it has a different social dynamic than hanging out with clay's or my single friends. at first we enjoyed our time with them. we met twice for dinner that first month. however, lately we've been feeling pressured. doreen sends four or five e-mails during the week and then a few text messages asking about our plans and if we want to meet them on saturday. i have tried to explain that we can't afford to go out every weekend and that clay and i sometimes have other plans. i have told them i'd be willing to host a game night or rent a movie, but i get the impression they consider it an insult. the issue here is that we don't like being pushed. one text or e-mail toward the end of the week is plenty for us. but receiving several inquiries all week makes us feel trapped. we have our own projects, friends and activities. we can't spend every weekend with this couple. as much as we enjoy spending time with them, how can we politely let them know that it is becoming too much? -- in demand in annapolis
### Answer:
 Subject: Setting Boundaries for Our Social Time

Dear Doreen and Bob,

We've really enjoyed getting to know you both and appreciate the opportunity to socialize together. However, we've noticed that our schedules have been filling up quickly with your invitations. While we value our time spent with you, we also want to ensure a healthy balance in our personal lives.

To help manage our commitments, we would like to establish some boundaries for our social interactions. We believe one text or email per week is sufficient for making plans. If this isn't convenient for you, we suggest setting up a regular standing date once every two weeks instead.

We understand that everyone has different communication styles and preferences, so we hope you can respect ours in this matter. We are more than happy to host game nights or movie nights at our place when our schedules allow it.

Please let us know if these suggestions work for you, or if there's a better way we can accommodate your invitations while maintaining a balance in our personal lives. We look forward to continuing our friendship and enjoying each other's company.

Best regards,
[Your Name] & Clay

### Question:
i am newly single after a 30-year marriage. would you please explain to me the protocol regarding intimacy? after how many dates is it appropriate to engage in intimacy? and afterward, should the man call the woman or the woman call the man? how long should one wait before calling? i'm afraid if i call too soon i'll appear needy, and if i wait too long to call i'll appear to be a player. -- tentative tom in tampa
### Answer:
 Dear Tentative Tom,

I understand that navigating intimacy and dating after a long-term marriage can feel confusing and intimidating. However, it's essential to remember that there is no one-size-fits-all answer when it comes to the timeline for intimacy or communication after a date.

Regarding intimacy, it's crucial to consider both your emotional readiness and compatibility with your partner. Intimacy should be based on mutual consent, comfort, and connection. There is no set number of dates required before engaging in intimacy. Instead, focus on getting to know the person, building trust, and feeling a genuine connection.

As for post-date communication, it's customary for either partner to initiate contact within a few days after the date. However, there's no need to adhere strictly to traditional gender roles in this regard. If you feel comfortable doing so, you can call or text your date to arrange another date or express your enjoyment of the previous one.

Regarding the timing of calls, aim for a balance between showing interest and respecting the other person's space. A day or two after the date is generally considered appropriate. However, if you feel that waiting too long might send the wrong message, trust your instincts and make the call when it feels right for both of you.

Remember, every relationship is unique, so focus on building a connection based on mutual respect, communication, and compatibility rather than adhering to rigid rules or expectations. Good luck!

### Question:
i do online dating. for safety, i use an alias. i look much younger than my 43 years, so i went out with a 29-year-old who thinks i'm 33. i have horrible luck with relationships and didn't think this one would be any different. boy, was i wrong! we have been dating three weeks now. how do i tell him i'm 43, have two kids he doesn't know about and a different name? or should i just break it off now? -- incognito in mississippi
### Answer:
 It's important to be honest and transparent in relationships, even if the truth may be difficult to share. Here are some steps you can take to address this situation:

1. Consider the reasons why you want to reveal your age and the existence of your children. If it's for transparency or fear of judgment, then it might be worth having an open conversation with your partner. However, if it's for no particular reason other than a feeling of guilt or deceit, then it may not be necessary to share this information.
2. Choose the right time and place to have the conversation. Find a quiet and private setting where you can both talk without interruptions. Make sure you have enough time to discuss everything thoroughly.
3. Be prepared for potential reactions. Your partner might be surprised, disappointed, or even angry. Try to anticipate their response and think about how you will handle it. Remember that everyone reacts differently, and it's important to listen to their perspective and validate their feelings.
4. Be honest but sensitive in your wording. Explain why you felt the need to hide your age and the existence of your children in the first place. Apologize for any deception or misrepresentation, and be open to answering any questions they may have.
5. If the relationship is important to you, give it a chance to continue. People can surprise us, and it's possible that your partner may still want to be with you despite this information. Be willing to work through any challenges that arise and focus on building a strong foundation of trust and communication.
6. If you feel that the relationship is not worth continuing after revealing this information, then it might be best to end it amicably. Breaking it off now may be the best option if you feel that the deception has caused irreparable damage or if you're not willing to address the issues honestly.

Ultimately, the decision is yours to make based on what feels right for you and what aligns with your values and priorities in a relationship. Good luck!

### Question:
is there such a thing as "real love"? you know, the kind where you never feel complete unless your partner is there? i read books about this kind of love. i see movies about it and hear songs, but i have never experienced it. i am not a teen-ager, abby. i am 47 years old and wonder if i have missed out. -- wondering in iowa
### Answer:
 "Real love," as you describe it, is a common theme in literature, media, and music. It's a deeply emotional connection where two people feel an intense sense of completeness and fulfillment in each other's presence. However, it's essential to understand that everyone's experience of love is unique, and what works for one person may not work for another.

While some people do experience this kind of profound connection, it's important to remember that relationships are complex and multifaceted. Love can take many forms throughout a lifetime, from passionate infatuation to deep companionship, and all of them are valid.

If you haven't experienced the kind of love you're describing yet, it doesn't mean you've missed out. Relationships require effort, communication, and mutual respect, regardless of the intensity of the initial connection. It's never too late to seek out meaningful relationships or to work on improving the one you have.

Remember that everyone's timeline for finding love is different, and there's no one "right" way to experience it. Focus on being true to yourself, building strong connections with others, and practicing open communication in your relationships. If you continue to put yourself out there and stay open to new experiences, you may find that the kind of love you're looking for comes to you when you least expect it.

### Question:
i am a divorced woman with one child, and i'm in a relationship with a younger man. he has his own home, and i have mine. he stays at my house three nights a week and every other weekend, when my child is not with me. he eats and grooms himself in my home and swims in the community pool. he never offers to pay for anything, like food, movie tickets, etc. if we go out, he expects me to pay my own way. in today's world is there any responsibility on a man in a relationship to pay for anything other than himself? are the days of men taking women out and paying for the date gone? shouldn't he offer to bring groceries during the times he spends at my home? what should a lady expect from a man in a dating relationship? -- gal in virginia
### Answer:
 In today's relationships, there is no one-size-fits-all answer regarding financial responsibilities. Each couple should have open and honest communication about their expectations and financial situations. While traditional gender roles may not apply to every relationship, mutual respect and consideration are essential.

In your situation, it's reasonable for you to discuss the financial aspects of your relationship with your partner. You can express your feelings about sharing household expenses or contributing to groceries during his stays at your house. It's important to remember that everyone's financial circumstances are unique, and finding a solution that works best for both parties is key.

As for dating activities, it's not unreasonable to expect each person to contribute according to their means. If you feel uncomfortable with the current situation, consider discussing your expectations and coming up with a compromise that suits both of you. Ultimately, a lady should expect respect, open communication, and consideration from her partner in a dating relationship.
