### Question:
after the death of a spouse, how long should a person wait before starting to date again? -- dottie in michigan
### Answer:


Dear Dottie,

There is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question as everyone's grieving process is unique. However, I would suggest that the person should take their time and prioritize healing and self-care before jumping into a new relationship. This could mean waiting anywhere from several months to a year or more after the death of a spouse. It's essential to honor the memory of the deceased partner while also allowing oneself to move forward at a pace that feels comfortable and healthy. Ultimately, it's about finding a balance between honoring the past and embracing the future.

### Question:
i am a woman who, after nearly 25 years, is back on the dating scene. those years were spent in a same-sex relationship. i just happened to fall in love with a woman. i have custody of our child from the union. i do not put a label on my sexual orientation. i would like to meet a nice man and pursue a new relationship. how do i let interested parties know about my past? being back in the dating world is difficult enough without having to explain an unusual history. -- back in the game in arizona
### Answer:


Dear Back in the Game,

It's understandable that you want to keep things simple and avoid unnecessary explanations when meeting new people. However, it's also important to be honest and upfront about your past relationships, especially if they involve children or legal arrangements. Here are a few suggestions:

1. Be clear about your relationship status: If you're divorced, widowed, or separated, make sure potential partners know that. If you're still legally married but living separately, clarify the situation as well. This will help avoid any misunderstandings or assumptions.

2. Address the elephant in the room: If your past relationship was same-sex and you're now interested in men, it might be helpful to acknowledge that early on. You could say something like, "I want to be transparent about my history. I was in a long-term relationship with a woman, but I've recently realized that I'm attracted to men as well."

3. Focus on the present: While it's important to be honest about your past, don't dwell on it too much. Try to steer the conversation towards your current interests and goals. This will help potential partners see you as a whole person, rather than just a sum of your experiences.

4. Be prepared for questions: If someone asks you about your ex-partner or your child custody arrangement, answer honestly but tactfully. Avoid getting defensive or overly emotional, and try to keep the conversation positive and forward-looking.

5. Trust your instincts: Ultimately, you know what feels comfortable and appropriate for you. If you're not sure how much detail to share, err on the side of caution and only reveal what you feel is necessary. Remember that you're in control of your own story, and you can choose how much (or little) you want to disclose.

I hope these suggestions help you navigate this new chapter in your life! Good luck, and happy dating.

### Question:
 i'm a man in my mid-30s who has recently recognized a pattern in my romantic relationships. a few of them lasted for several years, before they ended for various reasons. in between, i've gone a couple of years before seeking out and starting a new relationship. in the in-between time, i go online and meet people i have no intention of meeting in "real life," but who provide conversation and intimacy while i enjoy single life. i'm about to repeat the pattern again. i'm a few months out of a three-year relationship and have met someone online. it's great to chat online and over the phone, but we are not close geographically, and i have no intention of meeting in person. what's your insight on this, and do you think this is healthy for me? any ideas you can offer regarding this pattern? -- new relationships
### Answer:

i would say that it's perfectly fine to enjoy the company of someone online while you're single and not actively seeking a serious relationship. However, if you find yourself consistently repeating this pattern of long-term relationships followed by periods of casual online dating, it might be worth exploring why that is. Are you using these online connections as a way to avoid dealing with the emotional fallout of ending a relationship? Do you have trust issues that make it difficult for you to commit fully to a new partner? It's important to be honest with yourself about your motivations and communicate openly with any potential partners about your dating history and current preferences. Ultimately, the key is to find a balance between enjoying single life and being open to the possibility of a serious relationship when it comes along.

### Question:
i'm 20 years old and have never dated anyone. i have a lot of friends and do well in school and at work, and i try to be a good, kind, friendly person. what can i do to make myself datable? am i missing some crucial step in how to become a girlfriend? -- old maid in st. louis
### Answer:


Dear Old Maid in St. Louis,

Firstly, let me assure you that being 20 and never having dated is not uncommon at all. Many people take their time finding the right partner, and there's no need to rush into anything. That being said, if you're interested in dating and would like some guidance on how to become more datable, here are a few suggestions:

1. Focus on self-improvement: While it's true that external factors such as appearance and social skills can be important in attracting potential partners, it's equally crucial to work on yourself from the inside out. This means prioritizing your personal growth, learning new skills, and cultivating positive habits. By doing so, you'll not only become more attractive to others but also feel more confident and fulfilled in your own right.

2. Practice good communication: Effective communication is essential in any relationship, whether it's romantic or platonic. Make an effort to listen actively, express yourself clearly, and avoid making assumptions about what the other person is thinking or feeling. By doing so, you'll build stronger connections with others and be better equipped to navigate any challenges that arise in your relationships.

3. Set realistic expectations: It's important not to idealize romantic relationships too much. While love can be incredibly rewarding, it's also a complex and sometimes challenging experience. By setting realistic expectations for yourself and your partner, you'll be better prepared to handle any difficulties that arise and avoid feeling disappointed or disillusioned.

4. Prioritize mutual respect: Respect is the foundation of any healthy relationship. Make sure to treat others with kindness, empathy, and understanding, and expect the same in return. By prioritizing mutual respect, you'll attract partners who value your own self-respect and will be more likely to build a strong, lasting connection.

5. Don't be afraid to put yourself out there: While it's true that some people seem to effortlessly attract romantic partners, most of us have to work at it a bit. Don't be afraid to put yourself out there by joining clubs or organizations, attending social events, or simply striking up conversations with people you find interesting. By being proactive and open-minded, you'll increase your chances of meeting someone special.

Remember, becoming more datable is a process that takes time and effort. But by focusing on self-improvement, communication, realistic expectations, mutual respect, and putting yourself out there, you'll be well on your way to finding the right partner for you. Good luck!

### Question:
it seems i will never meet my "mr. right." every person i'm attracted to is either in a relationship or doesn't like me. my questions are: (a) when is it ok to just "settle"? and (b) do you have to be attracted to your mr. right, and/or can you take the risk that the "supposed" sparkle/love will come in time? -- tired of dating, landover, md.
### Answer:


Dear Tired of Dating,

Thank you for your question. While it's true that relationships require work, settling for someone who isn't a good fit for you is not the answer. Here are my thoughts on your questions:

(A) When is it okay to just "settle"?

Settling means compromising your values and standards in order to be with someone who doesn't meet your needs or wants. It's a short-term solution that often leads to long-term problems. Here are some signs that you might be considering settling:

1. You're willing to overlook red flags: If you find yourself making excuses for someone's behavior, it could be a sign that you're settling. For example, if your partner is consistently late or forgetful, and you're okay with it because you think they'll change, it might be time to reevaluate the relationship.

2. You're settling for less than what you want: If you're compromising on important aspects of a relationship, such as shared values, goals, or lifestyle preferences, it could be a sign that you're settling. For example, if you're dating someone who doesn't share your religious beliefs or career aspirations, and you're okay with it because you think they'll change, it might be time to reevaluate the relationship.

3. You're settling for less than what you deserve: If you're compromising on your own needs and wants in order to please someone else, it could be a sign that you're settling. For example, if you're dating someone who doesn't treat you with respect or kindness, and you're okay with it because you think they'll change, it might be time to reevaluate the relationship.

In short, settling is not an option. You deserve a partner who meets your needs and wants, and who treats you with respect and kindness. Don't compromise on your values or standards in order to be with someone who doesn't meet them.

(B) Do you have to be attracted to your Mr. Right, and/or can you take the risk that the "supposed" sparkle/love will come in time?

Attraction is an important part of any relationship, but it's not the only factor. Here are some things to consider:

1. Compatibility: While attraction is important, compatibility is equally crucial. You want to be with someone who shares your values, goals, and lifestyle preferences. If you're attracted to someone who doesn't meet these criteria, it might be worth considering whether they're truly the right person for you.

2. Chemistry: Chemistry is a complex concept that involves more than just physical attraction. It includes emotional connection, shared interests, and mutual respect. While chemistry can develop over time, it's important to have some level of it from the outset. If you're not feeling any chemistry with someone, it might be worth considering whether they're truly the right person for you.

3. Communication: Communication is key in any relationship. You want to be with someone who listens to you, respects your opinions, and communicates openly and honestly. If you're not feeling a strong connection in this area, it might be worth considering whether they're truly the right person for you.

4. Time: While some people believe that love takes time to develop, others argue that it's something that happens instantly. The truth is likely somewhere in between. It's important to give a relationship time to grow and develop, but it's also important to trust your instincts. If you're not feeling any sparkle or love after a reasonable amount of time, it might be worth considering whether they're truly the right person for you.

In short, attraction is important, but it's not the only factor in a successful relationship. Compatibility, chemistry, communication, and time are all crucial components as well. Don't settle for someone who doesn't meet your needs and wants, but also don't expect instant fireworks. Give a relationship time to grow and develop, but trust your instincts along the way.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or concerns.

Best regards,
[Your Name]

### Question:
my boyfriend, "clay," and i recently met another couple, "doreen" and "bob," who let us know they're interested in socializing together. i like the concept of double-dating. it has a different social dynamic than hanging out with clay's or my single friends. at first we enjoyed our time with them. we met twice for dinner that first month. however, lately we've been feeling pressured. doreen sends four or five e-mails during the week and then a few text messages asking about our plans and if we want to meet them on saturday. i have tried to explain that we can't afford to go out every weekend and that clay and i sometimes have other plans. i have told them i'd be willing to host a game night or rent a movie, but i get the impression they consider it an insult. the issue here is that we don't like being pushed. one text or e-mail toward the end of the week is plenty for us. but receiving several inquiries all week makes us feel trapped. we have our own projects, friends and activities. we can't spend every weekend with this couple. as much as we enjoy spending time with them, how can we politely let them know that it is becoming too much? -- in demand in annapolis
### Answer:


Dear In Demand,

It sounds like you need to have a frank conversation with Doreen and Bob. Explain that while you appreciate their company, you both have other commitments and priorities outside of your relationship with them. Let them know that you value their friendship but cannot make every weekend free for double-dating. Suggest alternative ways to spend time together, such as hosting a game night or movie night at your place, which will be more convenient for you both. Be clear and assertive in your communication, but also polite and understanding. Remember, maintaining healthy relationships requires openness, honesty, and respect.

### Question:
i am newly single after a 30-year marriage. would you please explain to me the protocol regarding intimacy? after how many dates is it appropriate to engage in intimacy? and afterward, should the man call the woman or the woman call the man? how long should one wait before calling? i'm afraid if i call too soon i'll appear needy, and if i wait too long to call i'll appear to be a player. -- tentative tom in tampa
### Answer:


Dear Tentative Tom,

Intimacy is a personal decision that should be made based on mutual comfort and attraction. There is no set timeline for when it's appropriate to engage in intimacy. Some people may feel ready after the first date, while others prefer to wait several dates. It's essential to communicate openly with your partner about your preferences and boundaries regarding intimacy.

After intimacy, it's traditional for the man to call the woman. However, this is not a hard and fast rule. If you're both comfortable with it, either person can initiate the call. It's essential to wait until you feel ready to make the call. There's no need to rush or delay the call unnecessarily. A good rule of thumb is to call within 24 hours of the date. This shows that you value the other person's time and are interested in seeing them again.

Remember, the goal is to find a partner who shares your values and communication style. Don't be afraid to communicate openly about your needs and preferences regarding intimacy and dating etiquette. By doing so, you'll attract partners who respect and value you for who you are.

### Question:
i do online dating. for safety, i use an alias. i look much younger than my 43 years, so i went out with a 29-year-old who thinks i'm 33. i have horrible luck with relationships and didn't think this one would be any different. boy, was i wrong! we have been dating three weeks now. how do i tell him i'm 43, have two kids he doesn't know about and a different name? or should i just break it off now? -- incognito in mississippi
### Answer:


Dear Incognito,

It's understandable that you want to be honest with your partner, but there are a few things to consider before making such a big revelation. Firstly, three weeks is still a relatively new relationship, and it may not have reached a point where such a bombshell would be appropriate. Secondly, the age difference and alias may already be causing some red flags for him, and revealing additional secrets could potentially push him away.

That being said, if you feel that your partner deserves to know the truth, then it's best to approach the conversation with sensitivity and honesty. Explain that you value his trust and respect, but there are some important details about your past that you haven't shared yet. Be prepared for any potential reactions, whether they be positive or negative, and try to answer any questions he may have as honestly and openly as possible.

Ultimately, the decision of whether to reveal your true identity and age is a personal one, and should be based on what you believe is best for both yourself and your partner. If you're unsure about how to proceed, it might be helpful to seek the advice of a trusted friend or therapist. Good luck!

### Question:
how do you attract single women while on a budget? -- gary in longwood, fla.
### Answer:


As a pragmatic dating advisor, I understand that attracting single women doesn't have to break the bank. Here are some tips for doing so on a budget:

1. Focus on your personality: Women are attracted to men who are confident, funny, and kind. Spend time working on yourself and improving your social skills instead of spending money on expensive gifts or activities.

2. Look for free events: Check out local community centers, libraries, and parks for free events like concerts, movie nights, and fitness classes. These are great places to meet single women who share similar interests.

3. Volunteer: Volunteering is a great way to give back to your community while meeting new people. Look for opportunities at local charities or non-profit organizations.

4. Join clubs or groups: Joining clubs or groups based on your hobbies or interests is an excellent way to meet single women who share similar passions. This can be anything from a book club to a sports league.

5. Use social media: Social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter are great places to connect with single women in your area. Join local groups, follow pages related to your interests, and participate in online discussions.

Remember, the most important thing is to be yourself and have fun. Don't put too much pressure on yourself or spend money you don't have trying to impress someone. Good luck!

### Question:
how do you respond if you're dating a much older man and someone asks if he is your father? -- the younger woman in vero beach, fla.
### Answer:
I would reply with a confident smile and say, "No, he's my boyfriend. We have an age difference, but we share a deep connection and respect for each other." If the person persists or seems judgmental, I might add, "We both believe that love knows no age limit, and we're happy together." Ultimately, it's up to you how much detail you want to share about your relationship. Just remember to stay true to yourself and your partner, and don't let anyone make you feel ashamed or uncomfortable for being in a loving relationship.

### Question:
is there such a thing as "real love"? you know, the kind where you never feel complete unless your partner is there? i read books about this kind of love. i see movies about it and hear songs, but i have never experienced it. i am not a teen-ager, abby. i am 47 years old and wonder if i have missed out. -- wondering in iowa
### Answer:


Dear Wondering,

While the concept of "real love" may be romanticized in books, movies, and songs, true love is not a magical feeling that completes you. Real love is a choice to care for and support another person, even when it's difficult or inconvenient. It involves respect, trust, and commitment.

It's never too late to experience real love, but it requires effort and vulnerability. You may need to work on your communication skills, learn how to compromise, and practice active listening. Real love also involves being open and honest about your needs and expectations.

Remember that everyone's definition of love is different, and what works for one couple may not work for another. It's essential to have realistic expectations and communicate openly with your partner about what you need from the relationship.

In short, real love is a choice, not a feeling. It requires effort, communication, and commitment. Don't give up hope; there's still time to experience it.

### Question:
i am a divorced woman with one child, and i'm in a relationship with a younger man. he has his own home, and i have mine. he stays at my house three nights a week and every other weekend, when my child is not with me. he eats and grooms himself in my home and swims in the community pool. he never offers to pay for anything, like food, movie tickets, etc. if we go out, he expects me to pay my own way. in today's world is there any responsibility on a man in a relationship to pay for anything other than himself? are the days of men taking women out and paying for the date gone? shouldn't he offer to bring groceries during the times he spends at my home? what should a lady expect from a man in a dating relationship? -- gal in virginia
### Answer:


As a pragmatic dating advisor, I understand that modern relationships are complex and often involve financial independence. In your specific situation, it's essential to communicate openly with your partner about expectations regarding finances. While traditional gender roles may have dictated men pay for dates in the past, today's women are more financially independent and empowered to cover their own expenses.

That being said, it's still polite for a man to offer to pay for dinner or movie tickets on occasion, especially if he initiated the date. However, if your partner consistently expects you to foot the bill, it may be worth having an honest conversation about why that is and whether it's causing any issues in the relationship.

Regarding groceries, it's reasonable to expect your partner to contribute when staying at your home for extended periods of time. This could involve bringing over a few items or offering to help with the grocery shopping. Again, communication is key here - make sure you both understand what's expected and how you can support each other financially.

Ultimately, in a dating relationship, a lady should expect mutual respect, honesty, and open communication about finances and other important topics. While traditional gender roles may have dictated certain behaviors in the past, modern relationships are more egalitarian and require both partners to be active participants in building a healthy and sustainable partnership.
