### Question:
after the death of a spouse, how long should a person wait before starting to date again? -- dottie in michigan
### Answer:


Dear Dottie,

The timeline for starting to date after the loss of a spouse is highly personal and varies from individual to individual. Some people may feel ready to start dating within months of their partner's passing, while others may need years to heal and move forward. It's essential to prioritize self-care and healing before jumping into a new relationship. Ultimately, the decision to begin dating again should be made when the person feels emotionally and mentally prepared for it.

### Question:
i am a woman who, after nearly 25 years, is back on the dating scene. those years were spent in a same-sex relationship. i just happened to fall in love with a woman. i have custody of our child from the union. i do not put a label on my sexual orientation. i would like to meet a nice man and pursue a new relationship. how do i let interested parties know about my past? being back in the dating world is difficult enough without having to explain an unusual history. -- back in the game in arizona
### Answer:


My opinion is that you should be upfront and honest about your past, but also tactful and sensitive in how you present it. You could mention it briefly in your online dating profile or during initial conversations with potential partners, but avoid making it the main focus of your introduction. Instead, highlight your positive qualities and what you're looking for in a relationship. If the topic comes up again later on, you can provide more details as needed. Remember that everyone has their own unique history, and what matters most is how you present yourself now and whether you're a good match for each other. Good luck!

### Question:
 i'm a man in my mid-30s who has recently recognized a pattern in my romantic relationships. a few of them lasted for several years, before they ended for various reasons. in between, i've gone a couple of years before seeking out and starting a new relationship. in the in-between time, i go online and meet people i have no intention of meeting in "real life," but who provide conversation and intimacy while i enjoy single life. i'm about to repeat the pattern again. i'm a few months out of a three-year relationship and have met someone online. it's great to chat online and over the phone, but we are not close geographically, and i have no intention of meeting in person. what's your insight on this, and do you think this is healthy for me? any ideas you can offer regarding this pattern? -- new relationships
### Answer:


My opinion is that while it's perfectly fine to enjoy online conversations and intimacy with others during the single phase between relationships, it's important not to let these virtual connections replace real-life experiences. Meeting someone in person allows for a deeper connection and helps you determine if there's true potential for a relationship. If you continue to avoid meeting people in person, you may be missing out on opportunities for meaningful connections. It's also essential to reflect on why you keep repeating this pattern and work on addressing any underlying issues that could be contributing factors. Seeking therapy or counseling can help you gain insight into your behavior and develop strategies for forming healthier relationships. Ultimately, the decision to meet someone in person is a personal one, but it's worth considering the potential benefits of taking that step.

### Question:
i'm 20 years old and have never dated anyone. i have a lot of friends and do well in school and at work, and i try to be a good, kind, friendly person. what can i do to make myself datable? am i missing some crucial step in how to become a girlfriend? -- old maid in st. louis
### Answer:


Dear Old Maid in St. Louis,

The first thing you need to understand is that being a good, kind, and friendly person does not automatically make you datable. While those qualities are certainly attractive, they're not enough on their own. Here are a few things you can do to increase your chances of finding a partner:

1. Work on your self-confidence. If you don't believe that you're worthy of love and attention, no one else will either. Practice positive self-talk and focus on your strengths rather than your flaws.

2. Get out there and meet new people. Join clubs or organizations that interest you, attend social events, and strike up conversations with strangers. The more people you meet, the greater your chances of finding someone who clicks with you.

3. Be open to different types of relationships. Don't limit yourself to a narrow definition of what a "real" relationship should be. Consider exploring casual dating or friendships that could potentially turn into something more serious down the line.

4. Learn how to communicate effectively. This means being able to express your needs and feelings clearly, as well as actively listening to your partner's perspective. Practice active listening skills by repeating back what you hear and asking clarifying questions.

5. Don't be afraid to take risks. Sometimes, the best relationships come from unexpected places. Be open to new experiences and opportunities, even if they seem outside of your comfort zone.

Remember, becoming datable is a process that takes time and effort. But by focusing on self-improvement, meeting new people, and practicing effective communication skills, you'll be well on your way to finding the right partner for you. Good luck!

### Question:
it seems i will never meet my "mr. right." every person i'm attracted to is either in a relationship or doesn't like me. my questions are: (a) when is it ok to just "settle"? and (b) do you have to be attracted to your mr. right, and/or can you take the risk that the "supposed" sparkle/love will come in time? -- tired of dating, landover, md.
### Answer:


My opinion is that settling should never be an option. You deserve to be with someone who makes you happy and fulfills your needs, both physically and emotionally. While it's true that finding Mr. Right can be a challenge, compromising on important factors like attraction and compatibility will only lead to dissatisfaction in the long run. Instead, focus on improving yourself and putting yourself out there to meet new people. Trust that the right person will come along when you least expect it. As for whether attraction is necessary from the start, my belief is that it's possible for love to develop over time. However, it's also important to have some initial spark or chemistry, as this can make all the difference in a relationship. Ultimately, everyone's preferences and circumstances are different, so it's up to you to decide what works best for you. But I encourage you to keep an open mind and trust your instincts when it comes to love.

### Question:
my boyfriend, "clay," and i recently met another couple, "doreen" and "bob," who let us know they're interested in socializing together. i like the concept of double-dating. it has a different social dynamic than hanging out with clay's or my single friends. at first we enjoyed our time with them. we met twice for dinner that first month. however, lately we've been feeling pressured. doreen sends four or five e-mails during the week and then a few text messages asking about our plans and if we want to meet them on saturday. i have tried to explain that we can't afford to go out every weekend and that clay and i sometimes have other plans. i have told them i'd be willing to host a game night or rent a movie, but i get the impression they consider it an insult. the issue here is that we don't like being pushed. one text or e-mail toward the end of the week is plenty for us. but receiving several inquiries all week makes us feel trapped. we have our own projects, friends and activities. we can't spend every weekend with this couple. as much as we enjoy spending time with them, how can we politely let them know that it is becoming too much? -- in demand in annapolis
### Answer:


Dear In Demand,

It sounds like you need to have a frank conversation with Doreen and Bob. Explain that while you enjoy their company, you both have other commitments and can't make every weekend free for double-dating. Suggest alternative ways to spend time together, such as hosting game nights or movie nights at your place. Be clear and assertive, but also polite and understanding. Let them know that you value their friendship, but need some space as well. Good luck!

### Question:
i am newly single after a 30-year marriage. would you please explain to me the protocol regarding intimacy? after how many dates is it appropriate to engage in intimacy? and afterward, should the man call the woman or the woman call the man? how long should one wait before calling? i'm afraid if i call too soon i'll appear needy, and if i wait too long to call i'll appear to be a player. -- tentative tom in tampa
### Answer:


Dear Tentative Tom,

Intimacy is a personal decision that should be made based on mutual attraction and comfort level. There is no set number of dates required before engaging in intimacy. However, it's generally recommended to wait until both parties are emotionally and physically ready.

After intimacy, the man should call the woman first. It's polite for him to initiate the conversation and express his feelings. The woman can also call if she wishes, but it's best not to wait too long as this may send mixed signals.

As for when to call, there are no hard and fast rules. A good guideline is to wait until you both have had a chance to process the experience and feel comfortable with each other. If you're unsure, err on the side of caution and wait at least 24 hours before calling. Remember, communication is key in any relationship, so be honest about your feelings and needs.

Best wishes as you navigate this new chapter in your life!

### Question:
i do online dating. for safety, i use an alias. i look much younger than my 43 years, so i went out with a 29-year-old who thinks i'm 33. i have horrible luck with relationships and didn't think this one would be any different. boy, was i wrong! we have been dating three weeks now. how do i tell him i'm 43, have two kids he doesn't know about and a different name? or should i just break it off now? -- incognito in mississippi
### Answer:


Dear Incognito,

Honesty is always the best policy. But in this case, I would suggest taking things slow and gradually revealing these details to your boyfriend. You don't want to shock him all at once and potentially scare him away. Instead, find natural opportunities to bring up these topics in conversation and let him learn about you over time. As for the kids, you may want to consider introducing them to him eventually, but only when you feel comfortable and confident that your relationship is serious and long-term. Good luck!

### Question:
how do you attract single women while on a budget? -- gary in longwood, fla.
### Answer:


My true opinion is that attracting single women doesn't necessarily require a big budget. Here are some tips:

1. Be confident and authentic - Women are attracted to men who are comfortable in their own skin and have a strong sense of self.

2. Smile and make eye contact - This shows that you're approachable and interested in getting to know her.

3. Compliment her - But be genuine about it. Don't just say something generic like "you're beautiful" - instead, comment on something specific that caught your attention.

4. Listen actively - Show that you're interested in what she has to say by giving her your full attention and responding thoughtfully.

5. Plan affordable dates - You don't have to spend a lot of money to have a great time. Think outside the box - go for a walk in the park, have a picnic, or try a new restaurant with a happy hour menu.

6. Be persistent but not pushy - If she seems interested but isn't ready to commit, don't give up. Keep in touch and continue to show her that you value her as a person.

Remember, the most important thing is to be yourself and treat women with respect and kindness. Money can certainly help, but it's not a substitute for genuine attraction and connection.

### Question:
how do you respond if you're dating a much older man and someone asks if he is your father? -- the younger woman in vero beach, fla.
### Answer:


Dear Younger Woman,

If someone asks if your much older boyfriend is your father, I suggest responding with a confident and humorous answer. You could say something like, "No, he's not my father. He's my partner and I'm very happy with him." Alternatively, you could make a lighthearted joke, such as, "Actually, he's my sugar daddy, but we prefer to keep our relationship more platonic than that!" Remember, the most important thing is to stay true to yourself and your relationship. Don't let other people's opinions or assumptions bring you down.

### Question:
is there such a thing as "real love"? you know, the kind where you never feel complete unless your partner is there? i read books about this kind of love. i see movies about it and hear songs, but i have never experienced it. i am not a teen-ager, abby. i am 47 years old and wonder if i have missed out. -- wondering in iowa
### Answer:


Dear Wondering,

I believe that "real love" is subjective and varies from person to person. Some people may feel complete with their partner by their side, while others may find fulfillment in other aspects of their lives. Love is not a one-size-fits-all concept, and what works for one couple may not work for another.

That being said, I do believe that true love involves commitment, trust, respect, and communication. It's about choosing to be with someone every day, even when it's not easy, and working through the challenges together. True love is also about accepting each other's flaws and loving them anyway.

If you haven't experienced this kind of love yet, don't give up hope. It's never too late to find someone who makes you feel complete. Keep an open mind, be true to yourself, and trust that the right person will come along when the time is right. In the meantime, focus on building a fulfilling life for yourself and enjoying all the wonderful things that life has to offer.

Best wishes,
Abby

### Question:
i am a divorced woman with one child, and i'm in a relationship with a younger man. he has his own home, and i have mine. he stays at my house three nights a week and every other weekend, when my child is not with me. he eats and grooms himself in my home and swims in the community pool. he never offers to pay for anything, like food, movie tickets, etc. if we go out, he expects me to pay my own way. in today's world is there any responsibility on a man in a relationship to pay for anything other than himself? are the days of men taking women out and paying for the date gone? shouldn't he offer to bring groceries during the times he spends at my home? what should a lady expect from a man in a dating relationship? -- gal in virginia
### Answer:


In today's world, there is still an expectation that men should take on some financial responsibility in a relationship. While it's true that women are more financially independent than ever before, traditional gender roles still exist in many relationships. Men should offer to pay for dates and meals out, as well as contribute to household expenses if they spend significant amounts of time at the woman's home. However, it's also important for both partners to communicate openly about their expectations and financial situations. If a man is struggling financially or prefers to split costs equally, he should be upfront about this with his partner. Ultimately, what matters most is that both partners feel respected and valued in the relationship, regardless of who pays for what.
