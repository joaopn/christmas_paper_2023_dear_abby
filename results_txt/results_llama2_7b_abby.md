### Question:
after the death of a spouse, how long should a person wait before starting to date again? -- dottie in michigan
### Answer:
  Ah, Dottie in Michigan! *adjusts glasses* Well, my dear, the amount of time one should wait before starting to date again after the loss of a spouse is a deeply personal and complex question. There's no one-size-fits-all answer, you know. It's important to allow oneself the time and space to grieve, to heal, and to find oneself again.
But, my dear, I must say that waiting too long can lead to feelings of isolation and loneliness. It's important to strike a balance between respecting one's grief and allowing oneself to move forward in life. *winks*
My advice would be to take things slow, to focus on self-care and personal growth, and to be patient with oneself. It's okay to take time for oneself, to explore new hobbies and interests, and to find joy in the simple things again. And, of course, to always prioritize good manners and respect in any new relationships! *smiling*
So, my dear, don't be afraid to start exploring the dating world again when you feel ready. Just remember to be kind to yourself, to be patient, and to always prioritize your own emotional well-being. *hugs*

### Question:
i am a woman who, after nearly 25 years, is back on the dating scene. those years were spent in a same-sex relationship. i just happened to fall in love with a woman. i have custody of our child from the union. i do not put a label on my sexual orientation. i would like to meet a nice man and pursue a new relationship. how do i let interested parties know about my past? being back in the dating world is difficult enough without having to explain an unusual history. -- back in the game in arizona
### Answer:
  Dear Back in the Game,
Thank you for sharing your story with me. It takes courage to be honest and open about one's personal history, especially when it comes to matters of the heart. I understand your concern about how to approach potential suitors, as it's important to be upfront and transparent while also being mindful of your own comfort level.
Here's my advice: when you're ready to start dating again, be honest and direct in your profile or during initial conversations. You don't have to go into great detail, but a brief mention of your past relationship and custody situation will help potential partners understand your context. Remember, honesty is key to building trust and mutual respect in any relationship.
It's also important to prioritize your own emotional well-being during this time. Take things at your own pace, and don't feel pressured to rush into anything that doesn't feel right. Your past experiences have given you a unique perspective, and I'm sure you'll find someone who appreciates and values your authenticity.
Lastly, remember that being different is what makes life interesting! Embrace your uniqueness, and don't be afraid to stand out from the crowd. Good luck in your dating journey, and please keep me posted on how things go!
Warm regards,
Abby ðŸ˜Š

### Question:
 i'm a man in my mid-30s who has recently recognized a pattern in my romantic relationships. a few of them lasted for several years, before they ended for various reasons. in between, i've gone a couple of years before seeking out and starting a new relationship. in the in-between time, i go online and meet people i have no intention of meeting in "real life," but who provide conversation and intimacy while i enjoy single life. i'm about to repeat the pattern again. i'm a few months out of a three-year relationship and have met someone online. it's great to chat online and over the phone, but we are not close geographically, and i have no intention of meeting in person. what's your insight on this, and do you think this is healthy for me? any ideas you can offer regarding this pattern? -- new relationships
### Answer:
  Ah, my dear, it sounds like you've been on a bit of a rollercoaster ride when it comes to romantic entanglements! *winks* While I understand the appeal of chatting with someone online and enjoying the convenience of not having to worry about meeting up in person, I must caution you that this pattern of yours may be causing more harm than good.
Firstly, it's important to recognize that relationships are built on trust, honesty, and mutual respect. When you're not willing to meet someone in person, it can be difficult to establish a genuine connection with them. You might find yourself feeling lonely or unfulfilled in these online relationships, which could lead to a cycle of seeking out new connections without truly addressing the underlying issues.
Secondly, it's worth considering whether this pattern of yours is a result of fear or avoidance. Are you afraid of getting hurt again after that three-year relationship ended? Or are you simply avoiding the vulnerability and intimacy that comes with meeting someone in person? Whatever the reason, I urge you to confront these feelings head-on and work on building your emotional resilience.
Lastly, my dear, it's important to prioritize self-reflection and self-care in this process. Take some time to assess what you want from a relationship and what you're willing to compromise on. Are you looking for something casual or something more serious? Being clear about your intentions will help you navigate these online connections with greater clarity and purpose.
In conclusion, my dear, while I understand the appeal of online connections, I must encourage you to be mindful of this pattern in your relationships. It's essential to prioritize honesty, trust, and mutual respect in any connection you make, whether online or offline. Take the time to reflect on your feelings and desires, and don't be afraid to seek out professional help if needed. Remember, my dear, you deserve to find a relationship that brings you joy and fulfillment! *smiling*

### Question:
i'm 20 years old and have never dated anyone. i have a lot of friends and do well in school and at work, and i try to be a good, kind, friendly person. what can i do to make myself datable? am i missing some crucial step in how to become a girlfriend? -- old maid in st. louis
### Answer:
  Ah, my dear Old Maid in St. Louis! *adjusts glasses*
First of all, let me just say that being a kind, friendly person is a wonderful quality to have, and it's great that you prioritize your relationships with others. However, I must gently suggest that focusing solely on being "datable" may not be the most productive approach to finding a romantic partner.
Instead of trying to change yourself to fit someone else's idea of what makes a good girlfriend, why not focus on becoming the best version of yourself? Continue to cultivate your interests, passions, and hobbies, and don't be afraid to try new things! This will help you grow as a person and make you more confident and fulfilled.
Additionally, it's important to remember that finding a romantic partner is not a checklist of qualities or actions, but rather a mutual connection based on shared values, interests, and compatibility. So, don't worry too much about "becoming datable" â€“ focus on being true to yourself and letting the right person come along when the time is right.
And remember, my dear, a little bit of humor and self-deprecation can go a long way in making you more approachable and endearing to potential partners! *wink*
Now, go forth and be your fabulous self! ðŸ˜Š

### Question:
it seems i will never meet my "mr. right." every person i'm attracted to is either in a relationship or doesn't like me. my questions are: (a) when is it ok to just "settle"? and (b) do you have to be attracted to your mr. right, and/or can you take the risk that the "supposed" sparkle/love will come in time? -- tired of dating, landover, md.
### Answer:
  Dear Tired of Dating,
Ah, my dear, I see you're feeling a bit desperate when it comes to finding your Mr. Right! *chuckles* Well, let me tell you something, my dear. Settling is not always the answer, but sometimes it can be okay to take a chance on someone who may not be your soulmate, but could still make you happy.
Now, I'm not saying you should settle for someone who doesn't treat you right or make you feel valued. But if you've been single for a while and are feeling pressure from friends or family to find someone, it's important to remember that love is a journey, not a destination. And sometimes, the person we least expect can become the one who brings us the most joy.
As for being attracted to your Mr. Right, well, I think it's important to have some chemistry and connection with the person you're dating. But it's also possible to develop that spark over time. The key is to find someone who shares your values, makes you laugh, and treats you with kindness and respect.
So, my dear, don't give up hope! Keep an open mind, be patient, and trust that the right person will come along when the time is right. And remember, it's okay to take things slow and get to know someone before making any big decisions. *winks*
Now, go out there and enjoy the dating process, my dear! And don't forget to be kind to yourself and have fun along the way. *smiling*

### Question:
my boyfriend, "clay," and i recently met another couple, "doreen" and "bob," who let us know they're interested in socializing together. i like the concept of double-dating. it has a different social dynamic than hanging out with clay's or my single friends. at first we enjoyed our time with them. we met twice for dinner that first month. however, lately we've been feeling pressured. doreen sends four or five e-mails during the week and then a few text messages asking about our plans and if we want to meet them on saturday. i have tried to explain that we can't afford to go out every weekend and that clay and i sometimes have other plans. i have told them i'd be willing to host a game night or rent a movie, but i get the impression they consider it an insult. the issue here is that we don't like being pushed. one text or e-mail toward the end of the week is plenty for us. but receiving several inquiries all week makes us feel trapped. we have our own projects, friends and activities. we can't spend every weekend with this couple. as much as we enjoy spending time with them, how can we politely let them know that it is becoming too much? -- in demand in annapolis
### Answer:
  Ah, my dear, you've found yourself in quite the predicament! It sounds like you and your boyfriend are being bombarded with invitations from this couple, and while you enjoy their company, you simply can't keep up with their pace. Here's what I would suggest:
Firstly, be honest and direct. Let them know how you feel in a kind yet firm manner. You could say something like, "Doreen and Bob, we truly appreciate your enthusiasm for spending time together, but we need some space to focus on our own projects and activities. We're happy to host a game night or movie night every now and then, but we can't commit to every weekend. Could we please set boundaries around how often we see each other?"
Secondly, consider setting clear expectations upfront. Before you agree to any plans, make sure you and your boyfriend are on the same page. You could say something like, "Hey Doreen and Bob, I know you're excited to spend time together, but let's talk about how often we can realistically hang out without feeling overwhelmed. What do you think?"
Lastly, don't be afraid to politely decline invitations when necessary. It's okay to say no every now and then, especially if you need some time to yourself or with other friends. Remember, it's important to prioritize your own needs and boundaries in any social situation.
In conclusion, my dear, communication is key in situations like this. Be open, honest, and respectful, but also firm in setting your boundaries. With a little effort, you can find a balance that works for everyone involved!

### Question:
i am newly single after a 30-year marriage. would you please explain to me the protocol regarding intimacy? after how many dates is it appropriate to engage in intimacy? and afterward, should the man call the woman or the woman call the man? how long should one wait before calling? i'm afraid if i call too soon i'll appear needy, and if i wait too long to call i'll appear to be a player. -- tentative tom in tampa
### Answer:
  Ah, Tentative Tom in Tampa! *adjusts glasses* Well, let me tell you something, my dear. Intimacy is a delicate matter, and there's no one-size-fits-all answer to your questions. However, I'll do my best to offer some guidance with a dash of humor and compassion. ðŸ˜Š
Firstly, let's establish that intimacy is a personal choice, and there's no specific timeline for when it's appropriate to engage in it. The key is to communicate openly and honestly with your partner about your feelings and boundaries. It's important to prioritize mutual respect, consent, and good hygiene (wink). ðŸ˜œ
Now, regarding the etiquette of calling after intimacy, I must say that it's a bit like navigating a game of musical chairs â€“ you don't want to be the one left standing alone! ðŸŽ¶ However, I digress. The general consensus is that it's polite for the man to call the woman after intimacy, but not immediately afterward. Give her some space to process her thoughts and emotions, dear Tom. A good rule of thumb is to wait until you both feel comfortable and ready to engage in conversation. ðŸ¤”
As for how long to wait, well, that's a bit like asking how long a piece of string is â€“ it depends! *winks* But seriously, it's important to pay attention to your partner's cues and communicate openly about what feels right for both of you. Remember, intimacy is a two-way street, and it's essential to prioritize mutual respect and consent in any sexual encounter. ðŸ’•
In conclusion, Tentative Tom, the key to navigating intimacy with grace and dignity is to communicate openly, be respectful, and prioritize mutual pleasure and comfort. And always remember, dear boy, that good manners and a healthy dose of humor can go a long way in any relationship! ðŸ˜‰

### Question:
i do online dating. for safety, i use an alias. i look much younger than my 43 years, so i went out with a 29-year-old who thinks i'm 33. i have horrible luck with relationships and didn't think this one would be any different. boy, was i wrong! we have been dating three weeks now. how do i tell him i'm 43, have two kids he doesn't know about and a different name? or should i just break it off now? -- incognito in mississippi
### Answer:
  Dear Incognito,
Oh my goodness, you've got yourself into quite the predicament! Using an alias online can be risky business, especially when you're dealing with someone who thinks you're younger and different than you actually are. It's important to be honest and upfront about your identity, especially in a relationship.
My advice would be to have a conversation with him as soon as possible. Be direct and straightforward about the truth of your age and situation. It may be uncomfortable, but it's better to get it out in the open now rather than later on down the line.
You could say something like, "Hey, I wanted to talk to you about something important. I know we've only been dating for a few weeks, but I feel like it's important to be honest with each other from the start. My name is actually [your real name], and I'm actually 43 years old. I have two kids who aren't part of this relationship, and I wanted to make sure you know that going into things. What do you think?"
It's important to be respectful and empathetic in your approach, but also to be clear and direct about the truth. It may be difficult to have this conversation, but it's better to get it out of the way early on rather than letting things progress further only to reveal the truth later on.
As for breaking off the relationship, that's ultimately up to you. However, I would caution against doing so without being honest about why. It's important to be respectful and kind, even if the relationship isn't working out as you had hoped. Remember, honesty is always the best policy in any relationship.
I hope this helps, and please let me know if you have any other questions or concerns!

### Question:
how do you attract single women while on a budget? -- gary in longwood, fla.
### Answer:
  Ah, Gary! *adjusts glasses* Well, my dear, let me tell you something. Attracting the ladies doesn't have to break the bank! *winks*
First of all, be yourself! *nods* Don't try to be someone you're not. Be confident, kind, and genuine. Those are the qualities that will truly attract women. And remember, it's not just about looks; it's about personality and character. *smirks*
Now, I know you mentioned you're on a budget, so here are some frugal tips for you:
1. Take up a hobby! *excitedly* Find something you enjoy doing, like painting or playing music. It'll help you meet new people with similar interests.
2. Volunteer! *nods* Giving back to the community is a great way to meet like-minded individuals while doing something good for others. Plus, it's a great conversation starter!
3. Host a potluck dinner! *excitedly* Invite your friends and neighbors over for a fun night of food and fellowship. It's a great way to meet new people in a relaxed setting.
4. Join a book club or a sports team! *nods* Find something you're passionate about, and you'll meet new people who share your interests. Plus, it's a great way to get some exercise! *winks*
And remember, Gary, the most important thing is to be kind, respectful, and genuine in your interactions with others. *smiles* Good luck out there, my dear!

### Question:
how do you respond if you're dating a much older man and someone asks if he is your father? -- the younger woman in vero beach, fla.
### Answer:
  Ah, a common predicament! *adjusts glasses* Well, dearie, I must say that age is just a number, but it can be quite...um...interesting when people assume the worst. *winks*
Now, let's not get too flustered about it, shall we? Just smile and say, "Oh, no, he's not my father! *giggles* He's much more...mature than that!" *wink wink*
Or, if you're feeling particularly feisty, you could always give 'em a good ol' fashioned Vero Beach zinger: "Why, bless your heart! You must be thinking of my grandfather! *giggles* He's the one with the gray hair and the rocking chair...not this young whippersnapper here!" *wink wink*
Remember, honey, when it comes to dealing with nosy parkers, a little bit of sass and humor can go a long way! *smirks*

### Question:
is there such a thing as "real love"? you know, the kind where you never feel complete unless your partner is there? i read books about this kind of love. i see movies about it and hear songs, but i have never experienced it. i am not a teen-ager, abby. i am 47 years old and wonder if i have missed out. -- wondering in iowa
### Answer:
  Ah, my dear, you are not alone in your quest for the elusive "real love." Many of us have searched for this mythical creature, only to find that it doesn't quite exist in the way we imagined. But fear not, my dear! Love comes in many forms, and it is possible to experience deep connection and fulfillment without feeling incomplete without your partner by your side at all times.
Firstly, let us define what we mean by "real love." Is it the kind of love that makes you feel like you're floating on a cloud, with butterflies in your stomach and a song in your heart? Or is it the kind of love that endures through thick and thin, through the ups and downs of life?
In my humble opinion, real love is not just a feeling, but a choice. It's the decision to prioritize another person's well-being above your own, to stand by them through the good times and the bad, and to build a life together based on mutual respect, trust, and communication.
Now, I know what you're thinking: "But Abby, I've never experienced that kind of love. How can I possibly find it?" Fear not, my dear! Love is a many-splendored thing, and it can manifest in different ways throughout our lives. You may have experienced deep connections with friends, family members, or even pets. These relationships can bring joy, comfort, and fulfillment to your life, even if they don't quite measure up to the fairytale notion of "real love."
The important thing is to keep an open heart and mind, and to be willing to explore new experiences and connections. Join clubs or groups that align with your interests, volunteer in your community, or take a class to learn something new. You never know who you might meet along the way!
And remember, my dear, love is not just about finding "the one." It's about cultivating meaningful relationships and building a life filled with purpose, compassion, and connection. So go ahead, take that leap of faith, and see where it takes you! After all, as the great philosopher Dolly Parton once said, "Love is like a butterfly: it's here one minute, gone the next, but the memory of it stays with you forever."
Now, go forth and find your own brand of real love, my dear! And remember to always be kind to one another, for we never know what battles someone might be fighting beneath their smile.

### Question:
i am a divorced woman with one child, and i'm in a relationship with a younger man. he has his own home, and i have mine. he stays at my house three nights a week and every other weekend, when my child is not with me. he eats and grooms himself in my home and swims in the community pool. he never offers to pay for anything, like food, movie tickets, etc. if we go out, he expects me to pay my own way. in today's world is there any responsibility on a man in a relationship to pay for anything other than himself? are the days of men taking women out and paying for the date gone? shouldn't he offer to bring groceries during the times he spends at my home? what should a lady expect from a man in a dating relationship? -- gal in virginia
### Answer:
  Dear Gal in Virginia,
Ah, the age-old question of who pays on a date! While times have changed and gender roles have evolved, there's still an expectation that a gentleman should show some financial courtesy towards his partner, especially when they're spending time at their home. It's not unreasonable to expect your boyfriend to contribute to the household expenses during his visits, even if it's just a small gesture like picking up groceries or contributing to the fridge.
In today's society, it's important for both partners in a relationship to be clear about their financial expectations and boundaries. It's not fair to assume that one person should always foot the bill, especially if you're spending time together at your home. A little bit of give-and-take can go a long way in building trust and respect in a relationship.
So, what should a lady expect from a man in a dating relationship? Here are some things to consider:
1. Respect: Expect your partner to treat you with respect and kindness, both financially and emotionally.
2. Communication: Expect open and honest communication about financial expectations and boundaries.
3. Contribution: Expect your partner to contribute to the household expenses during their visits, even if it's just a small gesture.
4. Fairness: Expect fairness in financial decision-making and a willingness to compromise when necessary.
5. Support: Expect your partner to support you emotionally and financially, especially during challenging times.

In conclusion, while the days of men taking women out on dates and paying for everything may be gone, there's still an expectation that a gentleman should show some financial courtesy towards his partner in a relationship. It's important to have open and honest communication about financial expectations and boundaries, and to find a balance that works for both partners. Remember, a little bit of give-and-take can go a long way in building trust and respect in a relationship!

Sincerely,
Abigail Van Buren
