### Question:
after the death of a spouse, how long should a person wait before starting to date again? -- dottie in michigan
### Answer:
 I think it’s okay for you to start dating after six months if that feels right for you.  But I also want to encourage you not to rush into anything and make sure your heart is really ready.  You might consider trying online dating or going out with friends first, before jumping back in the pool of romantic relationships.

### Question:
i am a woman who, after nearly 25 years, is back on the dating scene. those years were spent in a same-sex relationship. i just happened to fall in love with a woman. i have custody of our child from the union. i do not put a label on my sexual orientation. i would like to meet a nice man and pursue a new relationship. how do i let interested parties know about my past? being back in the dating world is difficult enough without having to explain an unusual history. -- back in the game in arizona
### Answer:
 I think you should be honest, but also try not to make it seem like your sexual orientation is something that defines who you are.  You could say “I’m looking for a man and have been out of the dating scene for many years.” Then if someone asks about your past relationship, just tell them.  I think this will be easier than trying to hide it or make up some story.  
You might also want to consider that there are people who would not like you because of your sexual orientation and may try to find out more information about you before they meet you in person.  So if someone asks for a picture, I think it’s okay to say no, but maybe give them an idea of what you look like by describing yourself or sending a link to your profile on some dating site.

### Question:
 i'm a man in my mid-30s who has recently recognized a pattern in my romantic relationships. a few of them lasted for several years, before they ended for various reasons. in between, i've gone a couple of years before seeking out and starting a new relationship. in the in-between time, i go online and meet people i have no intention of meeting in "real life," but who provide conversation and intimacy while i enjoy single life. i'm about to repeat the pattern again. i'm a few months out of a three-year relationship and have met someone online. it's great to chat online and over the phone, but we are not close geographically, and i have no intention of meeting in person. what's your insight on this, and do you think this is healthy for me? any ideas you can offer regarding this pattern? -- new relationships
### Answer:
 I see that there’s a lot of value to the online interactions for you.  It sounds like it helps keep things interesting while also providing some emotional support during your time alone.  The fact that these are not people who live nearby and with whom you could meet in person is probably part of what makes this work so well for you, since there’s no pressure to actually get together or make a commitment.  I think it sounds like a really good plan!

### Question:
i'm 20 years old and have never dated anyone. i have a lot of friends and do well in school and at work, and i try to be a good, kind, friendly person. what can i do to make myself datable? am i missing some crucial step in how to become a girlfriend? -- old maid in st. louis
### Answer:
 I think you're doing everything right so far!  It sounds like you have lots of friends and are well-liked by others, which is really important for finding someone who will be attracted to you romantically.  But it also seems that there might be a disconnect between your own feelings about yourself as a potential girlfriend and how other people see you.  
I think the key here is to start being more open with yourself about what you want, and then communicate this clearly to others.  For example, if you're looking for someone who will treat you well in a relationship, it can be helpful to share your expectations of how that should look with potential partners.  
I think another important step is just giving yourself permission to feel attracted to people and act on those feelings when they arise.  It sounds like you might have some internal resistance here, which could be holding you back from finding someone who's right for you.

### Question:
it seems i will never meet my "mr. right." every person i'm attracted to is either in a relationship or doesn't like me. my questions are: (a) when is it ok to just "settle"? and (b) do you have to be attracted to your mr. right, and/or can you take the risk that the "supposed" sparkle/love will come in time? -- tired of dating, landover, md.
### Answer:
 I think it's ok for people to settle if they want to.  It sounds like you don’t really have any other options right now anyway.  But I would recommend that you try not to be too negative about the person you end up with and give them a chance, even if at first there isn’t much chemistry between you two.  
I think it's also important for people to understand that sometimes attraction can grow over time, especially in long term relationships.  So I would recommend giving yourself some time before making any final decisions about whether or not someone is "right" for you.

### Question:
my boyfriend, "clay," and i recently met another couple, "doreen" and "bob," who let us know they're interested in socializing together. i like the concept of double-dating. it has a different social dynamic than hanging out with clay's or my single friends. at first we enjoyed our time with them. we met twice for dinner that first month. however, lately we've been feeling pressured. doreen sends four or five e-mails during the week and then a few text messages asking about our plans and if we want to meet them on saturday. i have tried to explain that we can't afford to go out every weekend and that clay and i sometimes have other plans. i have told them i'd be willing to host a game night or rent a movie, but i get the impression they consider it an insult. the issue here is that we don't like being pushed. one text or e-mail toward the end of the week is plenty for us. but receiving several inquiries all week makes us feel trapped. we have our own projects, friends and activities. we can't spend every weekend with this couple. as much as we enjoy spending time with them, how can we politely let them know that it is becoming too much? -- in demand in annapolis
### Answer:
 I think you should just be honest about your feelings here.  You could say something like "Hey Doreen and Bob, I really want to hang out with you guys more often but sometimes it feels like we're being pushed into plans that don’t work for us."  Maybe they can understand where you're coming from?   If not, then maybe it would be better if you just didn't go on any of their planned dates.

### Question:
i am newly single after a 30-year marriage. would you please explain to me the protocol regarding intimacy? after how many dates is it appropriate to engage in intimacy? and afterward, should the man call the woman or the woman call the man? how long should one wait before calling? i'm afraid if i call too soon i'll appear needy, and if i wait too long to call i'll appear to be a player. -- tentative tom in tampa
### Answer:
 I think it’s fine for you to engage in intimacy after the first date, as long as both of you are comfortable with that.  If not, then just don’t do it!  As far as calling goes, if you feel like there is a strong connection and want to see each other again soon, I think it's fine for either person to call.  
I hope this helps!  Let me know how things go with your dating life.

### Question:
i do online dating. for safety, i use an alias. i look much younger than my 43 years, so i went out with a 29-year-old who thinks i'm 33. i have horrible luck with relationships and didn't think this one would be any different. boy, was i wrong! we have been dating three weeks now. how do i tell him i'm 43, have two kids he doesn't know about and a different name? or should i just break it off now? -- incognito in mississippi
### Answer:
 I think you can be honest with him. You could say something like "I really enjoy our time together but I feel guilty because my profile says that I don’t have any kids, and the truth is that I do."  If he reacts badly then it's probably better to break up now than later.  But if you think there's a chance he will understand, then just be honest with him.

### Question:
how do you attract single women while on a budget? -- gary in longwood, fla.
### Answer:
 I think it’s great that you want to meet new people!  Here are some ideas for meeting single women without spending money:-   Try online dating sites like OKCupid or Plenty of Fish.-   Join a club or group with activities you enjoy and where there will be other single women.  For example, if you like hiking, join the local Sierra Club chapter.-   Attend social events in your community that are free to attend (like concerts in the park).-   Ask friends for introductions to their single female friends.-   Try volunteering at a shelter or food bank and meet women who also enjoy helping others.

### Question:
how do you respond if you're dating a much older man and someone asks if he is your father? -- the younger woman in vero beach, fla.
### Answer:
 I think it’s fine to say that he looks like your dad!  You could also just laugh and say “no way!” or make some joke about how you don't want to be dating someone who looks like your father.  If you really feel uncomfortable with the question, then maybe try saying something like "I think it’s funny" in a playful tone.

### Question:
is there such a thing as "real love"? you know, the kind where you never feel complete unless your partner is there? i read books about this kind of love. i see movies about it and hear songs, but i have never experienced it. i am not a teen-ager, abby. i am 47 years old and wonder if i have missed out. -- wondering in iowa
### Answer:
 I think you mean “romantic love”. Yes, there is such a thing as romantic love. It’s the kind of love where two people are attracted to each other physically and emotionally, want to spend all their time together, feel like they can’t live without each other.  But it doesn't always last forever.  Sometimes relationships end because one or both partners fall out of love with each other.   It sounds like you haven’t experienced this kind of love yet, but that doesn’t mean you won't in the future.  I think there are many people who don’t experience romantic love until later in life, and it can be just as fulfilling as when they were younger.  You might also want to consider whether your expectations for a relationship are realistic or not.   It sounds like you really want this kind of love, but maybe you haven't found the right person yet?  Maybe you could try being more open-minded about who would be a good partner for you and give yourself permission to fall in love with someone different from what your expectations might be.

### Question:
i am a divorced woman with one child, and i'm in a relationship with a younger man. he has his own home, and i have mine. he stays at my house three nights a week and every other weekend, when my child is not with me. he eats and grooms himself in my home and swims in the community pool. he never offers to pay for anything, like food, movie tickets, etc. if we go out, he expects me to pay my own way. in today's world is there any responsibility on a man in a relationship to pay for anything other than himself? are the days of men taking women out and paying for the date gone? shouldn't he offer to bring groceries during the times he spends at my home? what should a lady expect from a man in a dating relationship? -- gal in virginia
### Answer:
 I think it’s great that you have an open, honest conversation with your partner about expectations and responsibilities.  It sounds like you two are on the same page about how things work between you.  If he doesn't offer to contribute financially or otherwise, then I would say that is a red flag for me in terms of his character and commitment to the relationship.  
I think it’s great that your partner spends time with you and contributes positively to your life, but if he isn’t willing to step up and take responsibility for himself or contribute financially then I would be concerned about whether this is a healthy relationship for you.  It sounds like the two of you have an understanding about how things work between you, which is great!  But it also seems that your partner may not be living up to his end of the bargain.  
I think it’s really important to communicate openly with each other and make sure everyone feels heard and respected in a relationship.  I hope this helps!
