### Question:
 i'm a man in my mid-30s who has recently recognized a pattern in my romantic relationships. a few of them lasted for several years, before they ended for various reasons. in between, i've gone a couple of years before seeking out and starting a new relationship. in the in-between time, i go online and meet people i have no intention of meeting in "real life," but who provide conversation and intimacy while i enjoy single life. i'm about to repeat the pattern again. i'm a few months out of a three-year relationship and have met someone online. it's great to chat online and over the phone, but we are not close geographically, and i have no intention of meeting in person. what's your insight on this, and do you think this is healthy for me? any ideas you can offer regarding this pattern? -- new relationships
### Answer:
It sounds like you are experiencing a common pattern that can be healthy and positive. However, it's important to remember that not all romantic relationships are meant to last.

it seems i will never meet my "mr. right." every person i'm attracted to is either in a relationship or doesn't like me. my questions are: (a) when is it ok to just "settle"? and (b) do you have to be attracted to your mr. right, and/or can you take the risk that the "supposed" sparkle/love will come in time? -- tired of dating, landover, md.
### Answer:
(a) It's important to remember that relationships are a journey, and it can be challenging at times to find someone who you feel truly compatible with. It's okay to not find someone who you're completely drawn to, as long as you're open to trying other things. It's also important to remember that love is a journey, and that it can take time for both partners to understand each other's needs and desires.

(b) While it's true that being attracted to someone can sometimes lead to feelings of attraction and interest, it's not necessary to be in a relationship to experience these feelings. It's important to remember that love is a journey, and that it can take time for both partners to understand each other's needs and desires.

(c) Taking the risk that the "supposed" sparkle/love will come in time can be risky, but it can also be exciting. It's possible that you may find yourself falling in love with someone who is different from the person you were before you started dating. This can be a rewarding and fulfilling experience, even if it doesn't happen right away.

### Question:
my boyfriend, "clay," and i recently met another couple, "doreen" and "bob," who let us know they're interested in socializing together. i like the concept of double-dating. it has a different social dynamic than hanging out with clay's or my single friends. at first we enjoyed our time with them. we met twice for dinner that first month. however, lately we've been feeling pressured. doreen sends four or five e-mails during the week and then a few text messages asking about our plans and if we want to meet them on saturday. i have tried to explain that we can't afford to go out every weekend and that clay and i sometimes have other plans. i have told them i'd be willing to host a game night or rent a movie, but i get the impression they consider it an insult. the issue here is that we don't like being pushed. one text or e-mail toward the end of the week is plenty for us. but receiving several inquiries all week makes us feel trapped. we have our own projects, friends and activities. we can't spend every weekend with this couple. as much as we enjoy spending time with them, how can we politely let them know that it is becoming too much? -- in demand in annapolis
### Answer:
It sounds like you and your boyfriend have a good relationship with each other. However, it seems like doreen and bob are trying to take advantage of your friendship by asking you out on double dates. This is not a healthy way to build a relationship, and it could potentially lead to problems down the road.

To avoid this situation, it's important to be clear about what you want in a relationship. You should tell doreen and bob that you don't want to go out with them every weekend or host a game night just because they asked you out on dates. You also need to respect your friendships and make sure you have enough time for each other.

If you and your boyfriend are still friends, there are some things you can do to avoid this situation from happening again. For example, you could tell doreen and bob that you're not interested in going out with them anymore and that you'll be more open to meeting their friends if they invite you. You could also make it clear that you don't want to host a game night or ask out every weekend.

It's important to remember that relationships are built on mutual respect and trust. If you and your boyfriend are not on the same page, it can be difficult to build a healthy relationship. It's best to work together to find solutions that work for both of you

### Question:
i am newly single after a 30-year marriage. would you please explain to me the protocol regarding intimacy? after how many dates is it appropriate to engage in intimacy? and afterward, should the man call the woman or the woman call the man? how long should one wait before calling? i'm afraid if i call too soon i'll appear needy, and if i wait too long to call i'll appear to be a player. -- tentative tom in tampa
### Answer:
I would recommend that you take it slow when it comes to calling your ex. It is important to respect each other's space and boundaries, and not do anything that could cause harm or discomfort. If you are both comfortable with the relationship, it is a great idea to continue seeing each other and exploring new things together.

With regards to intimacy, it is important to remember that there is no one right answer. Each person's needs and desires will vary, so it is important to listen to your partner and respect their needs. It may take time for you and your ex to become comfortable with each other again, but it is worth the effort.

After a certain number of dates, it is appropriate to engage in intimacy. However, it's important to be mindful of how much contact you have. If you feel like you're becoming too involved or needy, it's okay to let go of that and wait for the right time.

With regards to waiting before calling, it's important to respect your partner's decision. It can be difficult to hear "I called too soon" or "I waited too long." However, if you and your ex are comfortable with each other and have a good relationship, it's worth exploring the idea of reconnecting.

It's also important to remember that relationships take time and effort. Don't get discouraged if things don't happen right away. It takes time for people to open up and for new relationships to form

If you decide to continue dating the older man, it's important to respect his decision and not judge him for his age or his relationship status. It's also important to be honest about your feelings and acknowledge that there may be other people who are a better fit for you.

It's also important to remember that relationships are a journey, and that it can take time and effort to find someone who is right for you. Don't get discouraged if someone asks if you are his daughter, as this is just another step in the process of finding love

### Answer:
Real love is a complex and multifaceted emotion that can be difficult to define. While it may not always feel like "love" in the traditional sense, it can still be a deeply satisfying and meaningful relationship. There are many people who experience love and romantic relationships, but only some of them will experience real love.

Real love is a commitment that involves a shared set of values, goals, and beliefs, as well as a deep emotional connection between the partners. It may involve physical affection, intimacy, and a sense of belonging, but it also includes other elements such as mutual respect, trust, and support.

Real love requires work and dedication from both partners, but it can also be a source of joy and fulfillment in our lives. If you are not yet ready to experience real love, there are many things you can do to build your confidence and self-esteem, such as seeking the advice of friends or family, practicing communication skills, and exploring other interests and hobbies.

I hope this helps!

It is also important to communicate clearly and respectfully with your partner, so that they understand your needs and expectations.

With regard to responsibilities in a man in a relationship, it is important to recognize that men have different needs and priorities than women.

In terms of responsibilities in a relationship outside of the home, it is important to recognize that men and women have different expectations and roles.
