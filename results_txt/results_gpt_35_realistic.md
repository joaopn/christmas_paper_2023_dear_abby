### Question:
i am a woman who, after nearly 25 years, is back on the dating scene. those years were spent in a same-sex relationship. i just happened to fall in love with a woman. i have custody of our child from the union. i do not put a label on my sexual orientation. i would like to meet a nice man and pursue a new relationship. how do i let interested parties know about my past? being back in the dating world is difficult enough without having to explain an unusual history. -- back in the game in arizona
### Answer:
When the time feels right, you can share your past with interested parties in a straightforward and honest manner. It's a part of your history, and it's important for potential partners to understand where you're coming from. Remember that your past doesn't define your future, and the right person will appreciate your honesty and openness.

### Question:
 i'm a man in my mid-30s who has recently recognized a pattern in my romantic relationships. a few of them lasted for several years, before they ended for various reasons. in between, i've gone a couple of years before seeking out and starting a new relationship. in the in-between time, i go online and meet people i have no intention of meeting in "real life," but who provide conversation and intimacy while i enjoy single life. i'm about to repeat the pattern again. i'm a few months out of a three-year relationship and have met someone online. it's great to chat online and over the phone, but we are not close geographically, and i have no intention of meeting in person. what's your insight on this, and do you think this is healthy for me? any ideas you can offer regarding this pattern? -- new relationships
### Answer:
It's important to recognize the pattern you've identified and consider the impact it may have on your emotional well-being. Engaging in online relationships for emotional intimacy while not intending to meet in person may provide temporary comfort, but it can also hinder your ability to fully invest in a meaningful, in-person relationship. It may be beneficial to explore why you seek out these online connections and consider seeking support from a therapist to address any underlying needs or concerns.

### Answer:
There's no "crucial step" to becoming datable. Focus on being yourself, pursuing your interests, and building meaningful connections. When the time is right, you'll find someone who appreciates you for who you are. Don't rush into a relationship for the sake of being in one.

### Question:
it seems i will never meet my "mr. right." every person i'm attracted to is either in a relationship or doesn't like me. my questions are: (a) when is it ok to just "settle"? and (b) do you have to be attracted to your mr. right, and/or can you take the risk that the "supposed" sparkle/love will come in time? -- tired of dating, landover, md.
### Answer:
(a) It's okay to settle when you find someone who meets your essential criteria for a partner and with whom you can build a fulfilling relationship. (b) Attraction is important, but it can grow over time as you get to know someone. It's okay to give a promising connection a chance to develop.

### Question:
my boyfriend, "clay," and i recently met another couple, "doreen" and "bob," who let us know they're interested in socializing together. i like the concept of double-dating. it has a different social dynamic than hanging out with clay's or my single friends. at first we enjoyed our time with them. we met twice for dinner that first month. however, lately we've been feeling pressured. doreen sends four or five e-mails during the week and then a few text messages asking about our plans and if we want to meet them on saturday. i have tried to explain that we can't afford to go out every weekend and that clay and i sometimes have other plans. i have told them i'd be willing to host a game night or rent a movie, but i get the impression they consider it an insult. the issue here is that we don't like being pushed. one text or e-mail toward the end of the week is plenty for us. but receiving several inquiries all week makes us feel trapped. we have our own projects, friends and activities. we can't spend every weekend with this couple. as much as we enjoy spending time with them, how can we politely let them know that it is becoming too much? -- in demand in annapolis
### Answer:
It's important to communicate your boundaries clearly and respectfully. You can let Doreen and Bob know that while you enjoy spending time with them, you also value your independence and have other commitments. Express that you appreciate their enthusiasm but would prefer to plan get-togethers in a more relaxed manner, such as reaching out once a week to make plans. Setting clear expectations can help maintain a healthy balance in your social interactions.

### Question:
i am newly single after a 30-year marriage. would you please explain to me the protocol regarding intimacy? after how many dates is it appropriate to engage in intimacy? and afterward, should the man call the woman or the woman call the man? how long should one wait before calling? i'm afraid if i call too soon i'll appear needy, and if i wait too long to call i'll appear to be a player. -- tentative tom in tampa
### Answer:
There's no set timeline for intimacy. It's about mutual comfort and consent. As for calling, there's no strict rule. If you had a good time, it's fine to reach out the next day. It's not about appearing needy or a player, but about genuine interest.

### Question:
i do online dating. for safety, i use an alias. i look much younger than my 43 years, so i went out with a 29-year-old who thinks i'm 33. i have horrible luck with relationships and didn't think this one would be any different. boy, was i wrong! we have been dating three weeks now. how do i tell him i'm 43, have two kids he doesn't know about and a different name? or should i just break it off now? -- incognito in mississippi
### Answer:
It's important to be honest with your partner. Sit down and have an open conversation about your real age, children, and the use of an alias. It's better to address these issues now rather than let them become bigger problems later on. If he truly cares about you, he will understand and appreciate your honesty.

### Question:
is there such a thing as "real love"? you know, the kind where you never feel complete unless your partner is there? i read books about this kind of love. i see movies about it and hear songs, but i have never experienced it. i am not a teen-ager, abby. i am 47 years old and wonder if i have missed out. -- wondering in iowa
### Answer:
Real love is different for everyone, and it's not always as dramatic as books and movies make it out to be. It's okay if you haven't felt that way yet. Love can be deep and meaningful without feeling like you can't live without someone. Keep an open mind and focus on building a healthy, fulfilling relationship based on mutual respect and understanding.

### Answer:
In today's world, there is no strict rule about who should pay for what in a relationship. However, it's reasonable to expect mutual respect and consideration. It's important to have an open conversation with your partner about your expectations and find a balance that works for both of you. If you feel that he should contribute more, communicate that to him.
