### Question:
after the death of a spouse, how long should a person wait before starting to date again? -- dottie in michigan
### Answer:
 There's no one-size-fits-all answer to this question as it depends on individual circumstances and emotions. Some people may feel ready to date again within months, while others may take years. Ultimately, the decision should be based on what feels right for you and not societal pressure or expectations. It's important to focus on healing and self-care before considering starting a new relationship. If you have any specific concerns or questions, it may be helpful to speak with a therapist or trusted friend.

### Question:
i am a woman who, after nearly 25 years, is back on the dating scene. those years were spent in a same-sex relationship. i just happened to fall in love with a woman. i have custody of our child from the union. i do not put a label on my sexual orientation. i would like to meet a nice man and pursue a new relationship. how do i let interested parties know about my past? being back in the dating world is difficult enough without having to explain an unusual history. -- back in the game in arizona
### Answer:
 It's important to be honest and transparent in your dating life, but also consider the timing and context of disclosing sensitive information. Here are some suggestions:

1. Wait until you feel a connection with someone before bringing up your past relationship.
2. Be clear about your current relationship status and intentions. For example, "I'm currently single and looking to start a new relationship."
3. If the topic comes up naturally in conversation, be brief and matter-of-fact. For example, "Yes, I was in a long-term same-sex relationship for 25 years, but I'm now single and open to meeting new people."
4. Focus on your present and future goals and interests rather than dwelling on the past.
5. Remember that everyone has a unique history, and what may seem unusual or difficult for you might be commonplace or irrelevant to someone else.
6. Consider seeking support from friends, family, or a therapist if discussing your past is causing anxiety or stress.

### Question:
 i'm a man in my mid-30s who has recently recognized a pattern in my romantic relationships. a few of them lasted for several years, before they ended for various reasons. in between, i've gone a couple of years before seeking out and starting a new relationship. in the in-between time, i go online and meet people i have no intention of meeting in "real life," but who provide conversation and intimacy while i enjoy single life. i'm about to repeat the pattern again. i'm a few months out of a three-year relationship and have met someone online. it's great to chat online and over the phone, but we are not close geographically, and i have no intention of meeting in person. what's your insight on this, and do you think this is healthy for me? any ideas you can offer regarding this pattern? -- new relationships
### Answer:
 While it's understandable to seek connection and companionship during the single years, engaging in long-term online relationships without the intention of meeting in person can hinder personal growth and limit the potential for deep, meaningful connections. This pattern may be a form of avoidance or fear of commitment, which could impact future relationships. It's essential to consider why you're hesitant to meet new partners in person and address any underlying issues that might be preventing you from forming lasting, authentic relationships. Seeking professional help, such as therapy, can provide valuable insights and tools for overcoming these patterns and fostering healthier romantic connections.

### Answer:
 While I cannot read your specific situation or personality through this text, I will share some general advice based on common experiences and research.

1. Self-confidence: Believe in yourself and your worth. Focus on personal growth, hobbies, and interests that bring you joy and fulfillment. Confident people are more attractive to potential partners.

2. Social Skills: Practice active listening, effective communication, and empathy when interacting with others. Building strong relationships takes time and effort.

3. Expand your social circle: Attend events, join clubs or groups that align with your interests, and engage in activities where you can meet new people. The more opportunities you have to connect with potential partners, the better.

4. Be open-minded: Don't limit yourself to a specific type of person or relationship. Keep an open mind and be willing to explore different experiences and perspectives.

5. Authenticity: Be true to yourself and your values. People are drawn to authenticity and genuine connections.

6. Self-care: Take care of your physical, emotional, and mental health. A happy, healthy you is more likely to attract a partner.

7. Patience: Finding the right person takes time. Don't rush into relationships out of fear or loneliness. Focus on enjoying the journey and growing as an individual.

### Question:
it seems i will never meet my "mr. right." every person i'm attracted to is either in a relationship or doesn't like me. my questions are: (a) when is it ok to just "settle"? and (b) do you have to be attracted to your mr. right, and/or can you take the risk that the "supposed" sparkle/love will come in time? -- tired of dating, landover, md.
### Answer:
 (a) Settling in a relationship is a personal decision and there's no one-size-fits-all answer. Some people choose to settle when they feel they have found someone who respects them, shares similar values, and makes them happy, even if the initial attraction isn't there. Others prefer to wait for that "spark" or deep connection. Ultimately, it depends on what you prioritize in a relationship and what makes you content.

(b) Yes, you should be attracted to your partner, but attraction can grow over time. It's important to remember that people change and develop throughout their lives. While initial attraction is crucial, it doesn't guarantee long-term compatibility or happiness. If you find someone who seems like a good match in other aspects of the relationship, it might be worth taking the risk and giving things a chance. However, if you feel consistently unattracted to someone or there are major deal-breakers, it may not be the best fit for you.

In your situation, it might be helpful to focus on self-improvement and expanding your social circle. This can increase your chances of meeting new people who could potentially become a good match. Additionally, consider seeking advice from friends or a professional counselor if you're feeling stuck in your dating life.

### Question:
my boyfriend, "clay," and i recently met another couple, "doreen" and "bob," who let us know they're interested in socializing together. i like the concept of double-dating. it has a different social dynamic than hanging out with clay's or my single friends. at first we enjoyed our time with them. we met twice for dinner that first month. however, lately we've been feeling pressured. doreen sends four or five e-mails during the week and then a few text messages asking about our plans and if we want to meet them on saturday. i have tried to explain that we can't afford to go out every weekend and that clay and i sometimes have other plans. i have told them i'd be willing to host a game night or rent a movie, but i get the impression they consider it an insult. the issue here is that we don't like being pushed. one text or e-mail toward the end of the week is plenty for us. but receiving several inquiries all week makes us feel trapped. we have our own projects, friends and activities. we can't spend every weekend with this couple. as much as we enjoy spending time with them, how can we politely let them know that it is becoming too much? -- in demand in annapolis
### Answer:
 It's important to communicate openly and honestly with Doreen and Bob about your feelings and boundaries. You can express that while you enjoy their company, the current frequency of socializing is making you feel pressured and trapped. Suggest alternative plans like hosting a game night or renting a movie at home as a more convenient option for everyone. Be clear that you value your individual time and activities, and that you'd like to maintain a balanced social life with them while also prioritizing your own personal projects and commitments. It may take some time for them to adjust to this new dynamic, but being upfront and respectful should help ease any potential tension.

### Question:
i am newly single after a 30-year marriage. would you please explain to me the protocol regarding intimacy? after how many dates is it appropriate to engage in intimacy? and afterward, should the man call the woman or the woman call the man? how long should one wait before calling? i'm afraid if i call too soon i'll appear needy, and if i wait too long to call i'll appear to be a player. -- tentative tom in tampa
### Answer:
 Intimacy is a personal decision that should align with your comfort level and connection with the other person. There's no set number of dates required before engaging in intimacy. It's essential to communicate openly about boundaries, feelings, and expectations.

Regarding post-intimacy communication, it's not about who should call first but rather focusing on showing genuine interest and care for each other. Waiting a day or two after the encounter to call can be a good rule of thumb. However, if you feel a strong connection, it's okay to break this rule. The key is to be attentive to the other person's feelings and respond accordingly with respect and consideration.

### Question:
i do online dating. for safety, i use an alias. i look much younger than my 43 years, so i went out with a 29-year-old who thinks i'm 33. i have horrible luck with relationships and didn't think this one would be any different. boy, was i wrong! we have been dating three weeks now. how do i tell him i'm 43, have two kids he doesn't know about and a different name? or should i just break it off now? -- incognito in mississippi
### Answer:
 It's important to be honest and transparent in relationships, even if it may be uncomfortable. I would suggest telling him the truth as soon as possible. You can explain that you used an alias for safety reasons on the dating app, but have grown to genuinely care for him. Share your age and discuss any potential concerns or questions he might have. Regarding your children, consider having a conversation about your past and how it has shaped who you are today. If he reacts negatively, then it may be best to end the relationship. However, if he is understanding and supportive, then there's a chance for a strong connection based on mutual respect and honesty.

### Question:
how do you attract single women while on a budget? -- gary in longwood, fla.
### Answer:
 Gary, there's no one-size-fits-all answer to this question as attraction depends on individual circumstances and compatibility. However, here are some low-cost ways to increase your chances of meeting single women:

1. Join free social groups or clubs based on shared interests. Meetup.com is a great resource for finding local groups.
2. Volunteer in your community. This not only helps others but also provides opportunities to meet like-minded individuals.
3. Utilize free dating apps and websites. Be genuine in your profile and messages to build connections.
4. Engage in social media. Join online communities based on shared interests and engage in meaningful conversations.
5. Attend local events, such as festivals or community gatherings, where you can meet people in a relaxed setting.
6. Practice good hygiene, dress appropriately, and be confident. These factors can make a big difference in attracting women without spending money.

### Question:
how do you respond if you're dating a much older man and someone asks if he is your father? -- the younger woman in vero beach, fla.
### Answer:
 I understand that this question can be uncomfortable and even embarrassing. However, it's important to remember that people may ask out of curiosity or ignorance, not with any malicious intent. Here are some possible responses:

1. "No, we're actually dating." This is a straightforward response that puts an end to the question.
2. "He's older than me, but we have a great connection." This response acknowledges the age difference and turns the focus back to the positives of the relationship.
3. "I prefer not to discuss my personal life with strangers." This response maintains your privacy and sets a boundary for unwanted questions.
4. "Why do you ask?" This response can help defuse the situation by making the questioner explain themselves, which may reveal that they had no ill intentions in asking.
5. "I find it amusing when people assume we're related." This response shows that you have a sense of humor and can turn a potentially awkward situation into something lighthearted.

Ultimately, the best response depends on your personal comfort level and the context of the situation. Remember to stay confident and assertive in handling any questions or comments about your relationship.

### Question:
is there such a thing as "real love"? you know, the kind where you never feel complete unless your partner is there? i read books about this kind of love. i see movies about it and hear songs, but i have never experienced it. i am not a teen-ager, abby. i am 47 years old and wonder if i have missed out. -- wondering in iowa
### Answer:
 I believe that "real love" or deep, profound connections can indeed exist between two people. However, it's essential to understand that everyone experiences love differently, and what works for one person may not work for another. Additionally, the idea of feeling incomplete without a partner is a common theme in romantic literature, movies, and songs, but it might not be a realistic expectation for everyone. Ultimately, it's crucial to focus on building healthy, fulfilling relationships based on mutual respect, communication, and shared values rather than an unattainable ideal of completeness.

### Question:
i am a divorced woman with one child, and i'm in a relationship with a younger man. he has his own home, and i have mine. he stays at my house three nights a week and every other weekend, when my child is not with me. he eats and grooms himself in my home and swims in the community pool. he never offers to pay for anything, like food, movie tickets, etc. if we go out, he expects me to pay my own way. in today's world is there any responsibility on a man in a relationship to pay for anything other than himself? are the days of men taking women out and paying for the date gone? shouldn't he offer to bring groceries during the times he spends at my home? what should a lady expect from a man in a dating relationship? -- gal in virginia
### Answer:
 In today's world, there is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question as relationships and expectations can vary greatly. However, traditional gender roles around paying for dates are not set in stone, and communication and mutual agreement are key.

In your situation, it seems that you are shouldering the financial burden of the relationship, while he contributes primarily with his time. This imbalance may lead to feelings of resentment or unfairness on your part. It's important for both parties to discuss their expectations and come to a mutual understanding.

Regarding groceries or other household items, it would be considerate if he offered to contribute, especially since he spends significant time at your home. However, ultimately, the responsibility falls on you as the homeowner.

A lady should expect respect, communication, and equality in a relationship. This includes discussing financial responsibilities and coming to an agreement that works for both parties. It's important to remember that every relationship is unique, and open and honest communication is essential for building a strong foundation.
