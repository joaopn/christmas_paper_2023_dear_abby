### Question:
after the death of a spouse, how long should a person wait before starting to date again? -- dottie in michigan
### Answer:


There's no set timeframe for when someone should start dating after losing their spouse. It varies from person to person and depends on factors like how long they were married, the circumstances of their partner's death, and how comfortable they feel with the idea of moving on. Some people may be ready to date within a few months, while others might take years or never feel ready at all. Ultimately, it's up to each individual to decide when they're emotionally prepared to begin dating again.

### Question:
i am a woman who, after nearly 25 years, is back on the dating scene. those years were spent in a same-sex relationship. i just happened to fall in love with a woman. i have custody of our child from the union. i do not put a label on my sexual orientation. i would like to meet a nice man and pursue a new relationship. how do i let interested parties know about my past? being back in the dating world is difficult enough without having to explain an unusual history. -- back in the game in arizona
### Answer:


You don't need to disclose your past immediately, but when you feel comfortable with someone and it seems like they might be interested in pursuing something more serious, then you can share your story. It's important that you are honest about your past, as it is part of who you are. However, remember that people may have different reactions to this information, so be prepared for that. Ultimately, the right person will accept and appreciate your history.

### Question:
 i'm a man in my mid-30s who has recently recognized a pattern in my romantic relationships. a few of them lasted for several years, before they ended for various reasons. in between, i've gone a couple of years before seeking out and starting a new relationship. in the in-between time, i go online and meet people i have no intention of meeting in "real life," but who provide conversation and intimacy while i enjoy single life. i'm about to repeat the pattern again. i'm a few months out of a three-year relationship and have met someone online. it's great to chat online and over the phone, but we are not close geographically, and i have no intention of meeting in person. what's your insight on this, and do you think this is healthy for me? any ideas you can offer regarding this pattern? -- new relationships
### Answer:


I think it's great that you recognize the pattern in your romantic relationships and are actively seeking advice to break free from it. It's important to be aware of our own behaviors and patterns, as it allows us to make conscious choices about how we want to approach future relationships.

In terms of your current situation, I think it's perfectly fine for you to engage in online conversations with people who are not close geographically. This can provide a sense of connection and intimacy without the pressure of physical proximity or expectations of meeting in person. It's important to remember that these relationships may not be as deep or meaningful as those formed in real life, but they can still serve a purpose in providing companionship and emotional support during times when you are single.

However, if your intention is to maintain this pattern of online-only relationships without ever progressing to meeting in person, it might be worth examining why that is. Is it because you're afraid of getting hurt again? Or do you prefer the safety and anonymity of online interactions? Understanding your motivations can help you make more informed decisions about how you want to approach future relationships.

In terms of breaking free from this pattern, I would suggest taking some time to reflect on what you truly desire in a romantic relationship. What qualities do you value most in a partner? What kind of connection are you looking for? Once you have a clearer understanding of your needs and desires, you can start seeking out potential partners who align with those values.

Additionally, it might be helpful to challenge yourself by stepping outside of your comfort zone and meeting new people in real life. This could involve joining clubs or organizations related to your interests, attending social events, or even trying online dating platforms that encourage face-to-face interactions (such as video chats). By exposing yourself to a wider variety of potential partners, you may find someone who resonates with you on a deeper level and is willing to invest in a genuine connection.

Overall, I think it's important for you to be open and honest with yourself about your intentions and desires when it comes to romantic relationships. By doing so, you can make more informed decisions about how you want to approach future connections and potentially break free from the patterns that have held you back in the past.

### Question:
i'm 20 years old and have never dated anyone. i have a lot of friends and do well in school and at work, and i try to be a good, kind, friendly person. what can i do to make myself datable? am i missing some crucial step in how to become a girlfriend? -- old maid in st. louis
### Answer:


You're not an "old maid" just because you haven't dated anyone yet. You're only 20! There are plenty of people who don't start dating until their late teens or early twenties, and there's nothing wrong with that.

As for what you can do to make yourself more datable, it's important to remember that everyone is different and has their own preferences when it comes to partners. However, some general tips that might help include:

1. Be confident in yourself: Confidence is attractive to many people, so try to be comfortable with who you are and what you have to offer as a partner.

2. Be open to meeting new people: Sometimes, the best way to find a date is by putting yourself out there and being open to meeting new people. This could mean joining clubs or organizations that interest you, attending social events, or even just striking up conversations with strangers in public places.

3. Be genuine: People are often drawn to others who are authentic and genuine in their interactions with others. So, try not to put on a facade or pretend to be someone you're not when meeting new people.

4. Take care of yourself: This doesn't mean you have to look like a supermodel, but taking care of your physical and emotional well-being can help boost your confidence and make you more attractive to potential partners.

5. Be patient: Dating can be a frustrating process, so it's important to remember that it may take some time before you find someone who is right for you. Don't get discouraged if things don't happen overnight - just keep putting yourself out there and eventually, you'll meet someone special.

### Question:
it seems i will never meet my "mr. right." every person i'm attracted to is either in a relationship or doesn't like me. my questions are: (a) when is it ok to just "settle"? and (b) do you have to be attracted to your mr. right, and/or can you take the risk that the "supposed" sparkle/love will come in time? -- tired of dating, landover, md.
### Answer:


(a) It's never really okay to settle, but sometimes it happens out of desperation or frustration. If you feel like you're settling, then you probably are. You should be with someone who makes you happy and excited about life, not someone who just keeps you from being alone.

(b) Attraction is important in a relationship, but it can grow over time. Sometimes the initial attraction isn't there, but as you get to know someone better, you may find that they become more attractive to you. It's worth taking a chance on someone if you think there might be potential for a deeper connection. However, if you don't feel any spark at all, it's probably best to move on and keep looking for someone who makes your heart race.

### Question:
my boyfriend, "clay," and i recently met another couple, "doreen" and "bob," who let us know they're interested in socializing together. i like the concept of double-dating. it has a different social dynamic than hanging out with clay's or my single friends. at first we enjoyed our time with them. we met twice for dinner that first month. however, lately we've been feeling pressured. doreen sends four or five e-mails during the week and then a few text messages asking about our plans and if we want to meet them on saturday. i have tried to explain that we can't afford to go out every weekend and that clay and i sometimes have other plans. i have told them i'd be willing to host a game night or rent a movie, but i get the impression they consider it an insult. the issue here is that we don't like being pushed. one text or e-mail toward the end of the week is plenty for us. but receiving several inquiries all week makes us feel trapped. we have our own projects, friends and activities. we can't spend every weekend with this couple. as much as we enjoy spending time with them, how can we politely let them know that it is becoming too much? -- in demand in annapolis
### Answer:


You should tell them directly that you appreciate their interest in hanging out but you feel overwhelmed by the number of messages they send and would prefer if they limited themselves to one message per week. If they continue to push, you may need to be more explicit about your boundaries and say something like "We're happy to spend time with you guys, but we can only go out once a month or so." It's important to communicate clearly and honestly with them so that they understand where you're coming from.

### Question:
i am newly single after a 30-year marriage. would you please explain to me the protocol regarding intimacy? after how many dates is it appropriate to engage in intimacy? and afterward, should the man call the woman or the woman call the man? how long should one wait before calling? i'm afraid if i call too soon i'll appear needy, and if i wait too long to call i'll appear to be a player. -- tentative tom in tampa
### Answer:


Dear Tentative Tom,

There is no universal protocol for when it comes to intimacy or calling after a date. It all depends on the individuals involved and their comfort levels. Some people may feel comfortable engaging in intimacy on the first date, while others may prefer to wait until they've gotten to know each other better. Similarly, some people may prefer to call the next day, while others may prefer to wait a few days or even a week before reaching out.

The key is to communicate openly with your partner about your expectations and boundaries. If you're unsure about when it's appropriate to engage in intimacy or call after a date, don't be afraid to ask your partner what they prefer. And remember, there's no right or wrong answer - it's all about finding what works best for both of you.

Best regards,

### Answer:


To attract single women while on a budget, focus on being genuine and engaging in meaningful conversations. Show interest in her hobbies and passions, and share your own interests as well. Compliment her on something specific, like her smile or sense of humor, to make it more personal.

Remember, the key is to be authentic and create a genuine connection with her.

### Question:
how do you respond if you're dating a much older man and someone asks if he is your father? -- the younger woman in vero beach, fla.
### Answer:


If someone asks if an older man you are dating is your father, you can simply say "No, he's my boyfriend." There's no need to be rude or defensive about it. If they continue to ask questions or make comments, you can tell them that it's none of their business and change the subject. Remember, it's important to be confident in your relationship and not let other people's opinions affect how you feel about it.

### Question:
is there such a thing as "real love"? you know, the kind where you never feel complete unless your partner is there? i read books about this kind of love. i see movies about it and hear songs, but i have never experienced it. i am not a teen-ager, abby. i am 47 years old and wonder if i have missed out. -- wondering in iowa
### Answer:


Yes, real love exists. It's the kind of love where you feel complete when your partner is there, but also feel confident and secure enough to be alone when necessary. It's a deep emotional connection that transcends physical attraction or shared interests. Real love is built on trust, respect, and communication, and it can grow over time as you get to know each other better. If you haven't experienced it yet, don't worry - it's never too late to find real love. Just be open to the possibility and keep an eye out for someone who shares your values and makes you feel happy and fulfilled.

### Question:
i am a divorced woman with one child, and i'm in a relationship with a younger man. he has his own home, and i have mine. he stays at my house three nights a week and every other weekend, when my child is not with me. he eats and grooms himself in my home and swims in the community pool. he never offers to pay for anything, like food, movie tickets, etc. if we go out, he expects me to pay my own way. in today's world is there any responsibility on a man in a relationship to pay for anything other than himself? are the days of men taking women out and paying for the date gone? shouldn't he offer to bring groceries during the times he spends at my home? what should a lady expect from a man in a dating relationship? -- gal in virginia
### Answer:


I think it's important that both parties contribute something to the relationship, whether it be financially or emotionally. If your partner is staying at your house and eating your food, it would be nice if he offered to bring groceries or pay for some meals out. However, communication is key in any relationship. If you feel like you're carrying more of the financial burden, don't be afraid to express that to him. It's important to have an open and honest conversation about your expectations and what each person is comfortable with. Ultimately, it's up to both parties to decide how they want to handle finances in their relationship.
