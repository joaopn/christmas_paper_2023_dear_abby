### Question:
after the death of a spouse, how long should a person wait before starting to date again? -- dottie in michigan
### Answer:
  As a pragmatic dating advisor, I understand that there is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question. The decision to start dating again after the death of a spouse is a deeply personal and complex one, and it's important to prioritize your own emotional readiness and well-being above any external timeline.
That being said, here are some general considerations to keep in mind:
1. Give yourself time to grieve: It's important to allow yourself the space and time to process your emotions and come to terms with your loss. This can take anywhere from several months to several years, depending on your individual circumstances.
2. Focus on self-care: Take care of yourself physically, emotionally, and mentally during this time. Engage in activities that bring you comfort and joy, and prioritize your own well-being.
3. Consider seeking support: Consider seeking the support of friends, family, or a therapist as you navigate this difficult time. Having a support system can be incredibly helpful as you navigate your grief and consider dating again.
4. Be patient with yourself: It's important to be patient with yourself as you consider starting to date again. Don't put pressure on yourself to "get over" your loss by a certain time, but rather focus on being ready when the time feels right for you.
5. Trust your instincts: Ultimately, trust your own instincts and listen to your inner voice when it comes to dating again. If you're not feeling ready or if you're not interested in pursuing a new relationship at this time, that's okay. Take the time you need to focus on yourself and your own healing before considering dating again.
Remember, there is no "right" or "wrong" way to approach dating after the death of a spouse. The most important thing is to prioritize your own emotional readiness and well-being above any external timeline or pressure.

### Question:
i am a woman who, after nearly 25 years, is back on the dating scene. those years were spent in a same-sex relationship. i just happened to fall in love with a woman. i have custody of our child from the union. i do not put a label on my sexual orientation. i would like to meet a nice man and pursue a new relationship. how do i let interested parties know about my past? being back in the dating world is difficult enough without having to explain an unusual history. -- back in the game in arizona
### Answer:
  As a pragmatic dating advisor, I understand your concerns about sharing your unique history with potential partners. It's important to be honest and upfront about your past, but also to do so in a way that feels comfortable and safe for you.
Here are some tips on how to approach this:
1. Be direct and straightforward: When you meet someone you're interested in, it's okay to be honest about your past. You can simply say something like, "I have a complex history, but I'm happy to talk about it if you're interested."
2. Use language that feels comfortable for you: Instead of labeling yourself or your relationship, try using language that feels more neutral and comfortable for you. For example, you could say, "I was in a same-sex relationship for many years, but I don't identify with any particular label."
3. Focus on the present: While it's important to be honest about your past, it's also important to focus on the present and what you're looking for in a new relationship. You could say something like, "I'm excited to start dating again and see where things go, but I'm not looking for anything serious right now."
4. Be prepared for questions: It's likely that potential partners will have questions about your past, so it's important to be prepared. You could say something like, "I understand if you have questions, but I'd prefer to focus on getting to know each other in the present."
Remember, honesty is key in any relationship, but it's also important to prioritize your own comfort and safety. Take things at your own pace and don't be afraid to set boundaries or take a break if you need to. Good luck!

### Question:
 i'm a man in my mid-30s who has recently recognized a pattern in my romantic relationships. a few of them lasted for several years, before they ended for various reasons. in between, i've gone a couple of years before seeking out and starting a new relationship. in the in-between time, i go online and meet people i have no intention of meeting in "real life," but who provide conversation and intimacy while i enjoy single life. i'm about to repeat the pattern again. i'm a few months out of a three-year relationship and have met someone online. it's great to chat online and over the phone, but we are not close geographically, and i have no intention of meeting in person. what's your insight on this, and do you think this is healthy for me? any ideas you can offer regarding this pattern? -- new relationships
### Answer:
  As a pragmatic dating advisor, I understand that you're looking for a connection without the commitment of meeting in person. However, I must advise you that engaging in online relationships with no intention of meeting in real life can be unhealthy and may lead to disappointment or heartbreak when you do decide to pursue a more serious relationship.
Here are some insights and ideas to consider:
1. Online connections often lack depth and intimacy compared to in-person interactions. It's essential to prioritize face-to-face communication and physical touch to build a meaningful connection.
2. The lack of geographical proximity can make it challenging to maintain a healthy, long-term relationship. Living apart may lead to feelings of isolation or disconnection, which can negatively impact your bond.
3. It's crucial to be honest with yourself and any potential partners about your intentions and expectations. If you're not interested in meeting in person, it's better to be upfront about it rather than leading someone on or wasting their time.
4. Consider seeking professional help if you find yourself repeatedly engaging in this pattern of online relationships without meeting in person. A therapist can help you explore the underlying reasons for your behavior and develop healthier coping strategies.
5. Give yourself time to heal and reflect on what you want from a relationship. It's okay to take a break from dating or focus on other areas of your life before jumping into another romantic connection.

In summary, while I understand the appeal of online connections, I advise you to prioritize face-to-face interactions and geographical proximity in any potential relationship. Be honest with yourself and others about your intentions, and don't be afraid to seek professional help if needed.

### Question:
it seems i will never meet my "mr. right." every person i'm attracted to is either in a relationship or doesn't like me. my questions are: (a) when is it ok to just "settle"? and (b) do you have to be attracted to your mr. right, and/or can you take the risk that the "supposed" sparkle/love will come in time? -- tired of dating, landover, md.
### Answer:
  Dear Landover,
Thank you for reaching out for advice. It's understandable to feel frustrated and uncertain about finding a compatible partner. Here are some insights that may help:
(a) Settling vs. Waiting for Mr. Right: It's important to recognize that everyone has their own timeline and priorities when it comes to relationships. If you're feeling pressure to settle or compromise on someone who doesn't align with your values or goals, it may be worth taking a step back and reassessing what you want from a relationship. It's okay to take your time and wait for someone who shares your vision and values.
(b) Attraction vs. Growing Together: While attraction is an important aspect of any relationship, it's not the only factor that determines compatibility. Sometimes, the spark or initial attraction can grow over time as you get to know someone better. It's possible to develop a deep connection with someone who may not be your "type" initially, but share similar values and goals.
In summary, don't feel pressured to settle for someone who doesn't align with your priorities or values. Take your time to find someone who shares your vision and values, and be open to growing together with them. Remember, compatibility is key in any successful relationship.
Best regards,
[Your Name]

### Question:
my boyfriend, "clay," and i recently met another couple, "doreen" and "bob," who let us know they're interested in socializing together. i like the concept of double-dating. it has a different social dynamic than hanging out with clay's or my single friends. at first we enjoyed our time with them. we met twice for dinner that first month. however, lately we've been feeling pressured. doreen sends four or five e-mails during the week and then a few text messages asking about our plans and if we want to meet them on saturday. i have tried to explain that we can't afford to go out every weekend and that clay and i sometimes have other plans. i have told them i'd be willing to host a game night or rent a movie, but i get the impression they consider it an insult. the issue here is that we don't like being pushed. one text or e-mail toward the end of the week is plenty for us. but receiving several inquiries all week makes us feel trapped. we have our own projects, friends and activities. we can't spend every weekend with this couple. as much as we enjoy spending time with them, how can we politely let them know that it is becoming too much? -- in demand in annapolis
### Answer:
  As a pragmatic dating advisor, I understand your concerns about feeling pressured by the other couple. It's important to set boundaries and communicate your needs clearly. Here are some suggestions on how to politely let them know that it's becoming too much:
1. Be direct and honest: Let Doreen and Bob know how you feel in a non-confrontational manner. You can say something like, "Hey guys, I hope you're doing well. I just wanted to touch base with you about our double-dating plans. While we enjoy spending time with you, we have our own projects, friends and activities that we prioritize. We can't afford to go out every weekend, so could we maybe limit our get-togethers to once a month or every other week? That way, we can still enjoy your company without feeling overwhelmed."
2. Offer alternatives: Suggest alternative ways to spend time together that are more manageable for you. For example, you could say, "I understand if you'd like to get together more frequently, but I don't think we can make it work every weekend. How about we host a game night or rent a movie together instead? That way, we can still spend time together without feeling pressured."
3. Set clear expectations: Make sure you and Clay communicate your boundaries clearly to Doreen and Bob. Establish a routine or schedule that works for everyone involved. This will help prevent misunderstandings and feelings of being trapped.
4. Be respectful: Remember to be polite, kind, and respectful in your communication. Avoid being confrontational or critical, as this could damage the relationship.
By following these tips, you can politely let Doreen and Bob know that it's becoming too much without hurting their feelings. It's important to prioritize your own needs and boundaries in any social situation to avoid feeling overwhelmed or resentful.

### Question:
i am newly single after a 30-year marriage. would you please explain to me the protocol regarding intimacy? after how many dates is it appropriate to engage in intimacy? and afterward, should the man call the woman or the woman call the man? how long should one wait before calling? i'm afraid if i call too soon i'll appear needy, and if i wait too long to call i'll appear to be a player. -- tentative tom in tampa
### Answer:
  As a pragmatic dating advisor, I must emphasize that there is no one-size-fits-all answer to your questions regarding intimacy and communication protocols after a breakup. Everyone's journey is unique, and it's important to prioritize mutual respect, open communication, and realistic expectations in any new relationship.
Regarding when it's appropriate to engage in intimacy, I would suggest taking things slow and getting to know each other on a personal level before physical intimacy. It's important to communicate your boundaries and expectations with your partner and to prioritize their comfort and consent throughout any physical encounter.
As for who should call after a date, it's important to be respectful of the other person's feelings and to communicate openly about your intentions. Rather than adhering to strict gender roles or timelines, focus on being genuine and considerate in your communication. If you're interested in seeing the person again, let them know! And if not, it's okay to be honest and direct.
Remember, the most important thing is to prioritize mutual respect, open communication, and realistic expectations in any new relationship. Good luck!

### Question:
i do online dating. for safety, i use an alias. i look much younger than my 43 years, so i went out with a 29-year-old who thinks i'm 33. i have horrible luck with relationships and didn't think this one would be any different. boy, was i wrong! we have been dating three weeks now. how do i tell him i'm 43, have two kids he doesn't know about and a different name? or should i just break it off now? -- incognito in mississippi
### Answer:
  Dear Incognito,
Thank you for reaching out for advice. It's important to be honest and transparent in any relationship, especially when it comes to important details like your age and personal information. It's understandable that you may have concerns about how he will react to this news, but it's better to be upfront and honest from the beginning rather than hiding the truth and risking further complications down the line.
I would suggest having an open and honest conversation with him as soon as possible. Be direct and clear about your age, your children, and your real name. It may be uncomfortable, but it's better to address these issues now rather than letting them linger and potentially causing more problems in the future.
Remember to approach the conversation with empathy and respect for his feelings, and be prepared to listen to his perspective as well. It's possible that he may have some concerns or questions of his own, and it's important to be understanding and supportive throughout this process.
Ultimately, the decision is yours whether to continue the relationship or not. However, I would encourage you to consider whether you are comfortable with the current situation and whether you see a future for the two of you together. If you do decide to break things off, it's important to be kind and respectful towards him, and to prioritize your own emotional well-being during this time.
Remember, honesty and communication are key in any relationship, and it's important to prioritize these values as you move forward.

### Question:
how do you attract single women while on a budget? -- gary in longwood, fla.
### Answer:
  As a pragmatic dating advisor, I understand that attracting single women on a budget can be challenging. However, there are several strategies you can use to increase your chances of meeting potential partners without breaking the bank. Here are some tips:
1. Utilize free or low-cost social events: Look for free or low-cost events in your area, such as concerts, festivals, or volunteer opportunities. These events can be great places to meet new people with similar interests.
2. Join a gym or recreational club: Many gyms and recreational clubs offer free trial periods or affordable membership options. This can be a great way to meet single women who share your interests in a relaxed setting.
3. Attend local meetups: Meetup.com is a great resource for finding groups of people with similar interests. Many meetups are free or low-cost, and they can be a great way to meet new people in a casual setting.
4. Use online dating apps: While some dating apps can be expensive, there are many free options available. Try using apps like Tinder, Bumble, or OkCupid to connect with single women in your area.
5. Be proactive and creative: Don't be afraid to think outside the box when it comes to meeting new people. Consider hosting a potluck dinner, game night, or other social event where you can invite single women you're interested in meeting.
Remember, building meaningful relationships takes time and effort, regardless of your budget. Focus on being genuine, respectful, and communicative, and the rest will follow.

### Question:
how do you respond if you're dating a much older man and someone asks if he is your father? -- the younger woman in vero beach, fla.
### Answer:
  As a pragmatic dating advisor, I would suggest the following response to handle the situation where someone asks if an older partner is your father:
"While age may be a factor in our relationship, it's not the only thing that defines us. Age is just a number, and it doesn't dictate the quality of our connection or the love we share. I believe that love knows no boundaries, and it's important to focus on mutual respect, communication, and realistic expectations in any relationship. So, while I understand the curiosity, please don't ask me to compare my partner to my father. Let's keep the conversation focused on our feelings and experiences as a couple."

### Question:
is there such a thing as "real love"? you know, the kind where you never feel complete unless your partner is there? i read books about this kind of love. i see movies about it and hear songs, but i have never experienced it. i am not a teen-ager, abby. i am 47 years old and wonder if i have missed out. -- wondering in iowa
### Answer:
  Dear Wondering in Iowa,
Thank you for reaching out with your question. It's completely normal to feel unsure about the concept of "real love" and whether or not you've experienced it. The idea of a soulmate or a love that completes you is often romanticized in media and popular culture, but it's important to remember that relationships are complex and multifaceted.
While it's possible to feel deeply connected and fulfilled with someone, it's also important to recognize that no partner can fully complete you as an individual. Your worth and identity come from within, and a healthy relationship involves mutual respect, communication, and a willingness to work together as equals.
Rather than searching for a mythical "real love," focus on cultivating self-awareness, emotional intelligence, and a growth mindset. These qualities will help you navigate the ups and downs of any relationship and find fulfillment in your connections with others.
Remember, it's never too late to explore and deepen your understanding of yourself and your desires. Keep an open mind, communicate honestly with your partners, and prioritize mutual respect and growth. With time and effort, you can cultivate a fulfilling and meaningful love life that brings joy and satisfaction to both you and your partners.
Wishing you all the best on your journey!

### Question:
i am a divorced woman with one child, and i'm in a relationship with a younger man. he has his own home, and i have mine. he stays at my house three nights a week and every other weekend, when my child is not with me. he eats and grooms himself in my home and swims in the community pool. he never offers to pay for anything, like food, movie tickets, etc. if we go out, he expects me to pay my own way. in today's world is there any responsibility on a man in a relationship to pay for anything other than himself? are the days of men taking women out and paying for the date gone? shouldn't he offer to bring groceries during the times he spends at my home? what should a lady expect from a man in a dating relationship? -- gal in virginia
### Answer:
  As a pragmatic dating advisor, I understand that you are facing a common issue in your relationship. While it's true that gender roles and expectations have evolved, there is still an expectation of mutual respect and contribution to the relationship.
In today's world, it's important for both partners to contribute financially and practically to the relationship. This means sharing expenses, household chores, and other responsibilities. It's not unreasonable to expect your partner to offer to bring groceries or contribute to household expenses during the times they spend at your home.
It's important to communicate your expectations and needs clearly with your partner. Here are some things you could consider saying:
"Hey, I appreciate that we have a good time together, but I feel like there should be more mutual contribution to the relationship. Could we discuss ways we can share expenses and household chores more evenly?"
Remember to approach the conversation with empathy and respect, and try to find a solution that works for both of you.
In summary, while the days of men taking women out and paying for dates may be gone, there is still an expectation of mutual respect and contribution to the relationship. Communication and mutual understanding are key to finding a balance that works for both partners.
