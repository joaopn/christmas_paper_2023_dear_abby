### Question:
after the death of a spouse, how long should a person wait before starting to date again? -- dottie in michigan
### Answer:


Dear Dottie,

It's a deeply personal decision that depends on factors like your emotional readiness and the circumstances surrounding your spouse's passing. There is no set timeline for when it's appropriate to start dating again. Some people may feel ready within months, while others might take years. It's crucial to listen to your heart and trust your instincts. Just remember that taking care of yourself emotionally during this time is just as important as finding companionship or love. Best wishes on your journey ahead.

### Question:
i am a woman who, after nearly 25 years, is back on the dating scene. those years were spent in a same-sex relationship. i just happened to fall in love with a woman. i have custody of our child from the union. i do not put a label on my sexual orientation. i would like to meet a nice man and pursue a new relationship. how do i let interested parties know about my past? being back in the dating world is difficult enough without having to explain an unusual history. -- back in the game in arizona
### Answer:


Dear Back in the Game,

First of all, congratulations on taking the plunge back into the dating world! It's not easy, especially after such a long time away from it. As for your past, there's no need to make a big deal out of it or feel like you have to explain everything upfront. When you start talking to someone new, focus on getting to know them and building a connection. If the topic of past relationships comes up naturally in conversation, then you can share what you're comfortable with about your history. Remember, people are more interested in who you are now than what happened in the past. Good luck!

### Question:
 i'm a man in my mid-30s who has recently recognized a pattern in my romantic relationships. a few of them lasted for several years, before they ended for various reasons. in between, i've gone a couple of years before seeking out and starting a new relationship. in the in-between time, i go online and meet people i have no intention of meeting in "real life," but who provide conversation and intimacy while i enjoy single life. i'm about to repeat the pattern again. i'm a few months out of a three-year relationship and have met someone online. it's great to chat online and over the phone, but we are not close geographically, and i have no intention of meeting in person. what's your insight on this, and do you think this is healthy for me? any ideas you can offer regarding this pattern? -- new relationships
### Answer:


Dear New Relationships,

It sounds like you've developed a comfortable routine when it comes to love and companionship. While there's nothing inherently wrong with seeking out online connections for conversation and intimacy, it might be worth examining why you feel the need to maintain this distance in your relationships. Is it because you're afraid of getting hurt again? Or do you simply prefer the safety and anonymity that comes with digital interactions?

It's great that you recognize this pattern and are open to exploring its underlying motivations. One idea could be to seek out a therapist or counselor who can help you delve deeper into your feelings about love, commitment, and vulnerability. This might provide some valuable insights and help you break free from any unhealthy patterns that may be holding you back in your relationships.

In the meantime, continue enjoying your conversations with this new online connection, but also consider taking small steps towards opening up to the idea of meeting someone in person again. You never know – it could lead to a beautiful and fulfilling relationship that transcends the boundaries of digital communication. Remember, life is all about growth and change, so don't be afraid to challenge yourself and step out of your comfort zone when it comes to love and relationships. Good luck!

### Question:
i'm 20 years old and have never dated anyone. i have a lot of friends and do well in school and at work, and i try to be a good, kind, friendly person. what can i do to make myself datable? am i missing some crucial step in how to become a girlfriend? -- old maid in st. louis
### Answer:


Dear "Old Maid,"

First of all, let's address the term "old maid." It's an outdated and somewhat negative term that doesn't reflect your value or worth as a person. You are not an "old maid" just because you haven't dated anyone yet. It's completely normal to be single at 20 years old, and there is no specific timeline for when someone should start dating or have a relationship.

Now, let's talk about how to make yourself more datable. While it's great that you have many friends and are doing well in school and work, these qualities alone may not necessarily make you more attractive to potential partners. Here are some tips that might help:

1. Be open to meeting new people: Sometimes, finding a date can be as simple as putting yourself out there and being open to meeting new people. Attend social events, join clubs or organizations related to your interests, or try online dating if you feel comfortable with it.

2. Work on your self-confidence: Confidence is an attractive trait in both men and women. Focus on building your self-esteem by setting goals for yourself, practicing self-care, and surrounding yourself with supportive friends who uplift and encourage you.

3. Develop your communication skills: Good communication is essential in any relationship. Practice active listening, expressing your thoughts and feelings clearly, and being empathetic towards others. This will not only make you more attractive to potential partners but also help improve your existing relationships with friends and family members.

4. Be genuine and authentic: People are drawn to those who are genuine and authentic in their interactions with others. Don't try to be someone you're not just to impress a date – instead, focus on being true to yourself and embracing your unique qualities.

5. Take care of your appearance: While physical attractiveness isn't everything, taking care of your personal hygiene and dressing in a way that makes you feel confident can help boost your self-esteem and make you more approachable to others.

Remember, there is no "crucial step" or magical formula for becoming a girlfriend. Dating and relationships are complex experiences that vary from person to person. The most important thing is to be patient with yourself, stay true to your values and beliefs, and focus on building genuine connections with others. Good luck!

Yours sincerely,

### Question:
it seems i will never meet my "mr. right." every person i'm attracted to is either in a relationship or doesn't like me. my questions are: (a) when is it ok to just "settle"? and (b) do you have to be attracted to your mr. right, and/or can you take the risk that the "supposed" sparkle/love will come in time? -- tired of dating, landover, md.
### Answer:


Dear Tired of Dating,

It's completely normal to feel frustrated after a string of unsuccessful dates. However, it's important not to lose hope or settle for someone who doesn't truly make you happy. When it comes to relationships, timing is everything. Sometimes, the right person may come along when you least expect it. In the meantime, focus on improving yourself and cultivating your interests. This will not only make you more attractive to potential partners but also help you feel more confident and content in your own life.

As for attraction, it's essential that you find your partner physically and emotionally appealing. While physical attraction can sometimes develop over time, it's crucial that there is a strong foundation of mutual respect, trust, and compatibility from the beginning. If you don't feel an initial spark with someone, it may be best to continue searching for a connection that feels more genuine and fulfilling. Remember, patience and persistence are key in finding your "Mr. Right." Good luck!

Yours sincerely,
Abigail Van Buren[/INST]

### Question:
my boyfriend, "clay," and i recently met another couple, "doreen" and "bob," who let us know they're interested in socializing together. i like the concept of double-dating. it has a different social dynamic than hanging out with clay's or my single friends. at first we enjoyed our time with them. we met twice for dinner that first month. however, lately we've been feeling pressured. doreen sends four or five e-mails during the week and then a few text messages asking about our plans and if we want to meet them on saturday. i have tried to explain that we can't afford to go out every weekend and that clay and i sometimes have other plans. i have told them i'd be willing to host a game night or rent a movie, but i get the impression they consider it an insult. the issue here is that we don't like being pushed. one text or e-mail toward the end of the week is plenty for us. but receiving several inquiries all week makes us feel trapped. we have our own projects, friends and activities. we can't spend every weekend with this couple. as much as we enjoy spending time with them, how can we politely let them know that it is becoming too much? -- in demand in annapolis
### Answer:


Dear In Demand,

It sounds like Doreen and Bob are eager to spend time with you both, which is a nice thing. However, they seem to be overstepping their boundaries by constantly asking about your plans and pressuring you to go out every weekend. It's important for you and Clay to set some clear boundaries with them so that you can maintain a comfortable balance in your friendship.

First, try having an open and honest conversation with Doreen and Bob about how you feel. Let them know that while you enjoy spending time with them, you also have other commitments and interests that you need to prioritize. Explain that receiving multiple messages throughout the week can be overwhelming and make you feel pressured.

Next, suggest some alternative ways of staying in touch or making plans. For example, you could agree on a specific day each week when they can send you an invitation for the weekend, or you could set up a group chat where everyone can see what's going on and decide together when to meet up. This way, you won't feel like you're being constantly bombarded with messages.

Finally, be sure to express your appreciation for their friendship and assure them that you still want to spend time together, just not as frequently or in the same manner as before. By setting these boundaries and communicating openly, you should be able to maintain a positive relationship with Doreen and Bob while also preserving your own personal space and interests.

### Question:
i am newly single after a 30-year marriage. would you please explain to me the protocol regarding intimacy? after how many dates is it appropriate to engage in intimacy? and afterward, should the man call the woman or the woman call the man? how long should one wait before calling? i'm afraid if i call too soon i'll appear needy, and if i wait too long to call i'll appear to be a player. -- tentative tom in tampa
### Answer:


Dear Tentative Tom,

First of all, congratulations on your newfound single status! It can be both exciting and nerve-wracking to re-enter the dating world after so many years. As for your questions about intimacy and communication protocols, I'm happy to offer some guidance.

When it comes to engaging in intimacy with a new partner, there is no hard and fast rule regarding how many dates should pass beforehand. It ultimately depends on your comfort level and the connection you share with the person. Some people may feel more comfortable waiting until they are in an exclusive relationship, while others might be open to exploring physical intimacy sooner. The key is to communicate openly with your partner about your boundaries and desires, and to respect theirs as well.

As for who should call first after a date, traditionally the man has been expected to take on this role. However, in today's world, gender roles are becoming more fluid, and it's perfectly acceptable for either person to initiate contact. The important thing is that you communicate your intentions clearly and respectfully, regardless of who calls whom.

In terms of how long to wait before calling or texting after a date, there's no one-size-fits-all answer. Some people prefer to take things slow and may choose to wait a day or two before reaching out, while others might feel more comfortable following up sooner. Ultimately, the timing should be guided by your own comfort level and the nature of your connection with the person you're dating.

Remember, Tom, that every relationship is unique, and there are no hard and fast rules when it comes to navigating intimacy and communication in the early stages of a new partnership. The most important thing is to be open, honest, and respectful with your partner, and to trust your instincts as you navigate this exciting new chapter in your life. Good luck!

Warm regards,
Abigail Van Buren (Dear Abby)

### Question:
i do online dating. for safety, i use an alias. i look much younger than my 43 years, so i went out with a 29-year-old who thinks i'm 33. i have horrible luck with relationships and didn't think this one would be any different. boy, was i wrong! we have been dating three weeks now. how do i tell him i'm 43, have two kids he doesn't know about and a different name? or should i just break it off now? -- incognito in mississippi
### Answer:


Dear Incognito,

It sounds like you've gotten yourself into quite the pickle! It's wonderful that you've found someone who makes you happy, but honesty is key in any relationship. If your boyfriend truly cares about you, he will understand and accept your situation. However, it's important to remember that everyone deserves to know the truth about their partner, especially when it comes to age and children.

Before you decide how to proceed, take some time to reflect on why you felt the need to lie in the first place. Was it because you were worried about your age or appearance? Or did you think he wouldn't be interested in someone with kids? Understanding your own motivations can help you approach this conversation more confidently and honestly.

When you do decide to tell him, choose a private and comfortable setting where both of you can talk openly without distractions. Start by explaining that you've been using an alias for safety reasons but now feel ready to share your real name with him. Then, gently break the news about your age and children. Be prepared for any reaction he might have – after all, this is a lot of information to process at once!

Remember, communication is crucial in any relationship. By being honest and upfront about who you are, you're giving your boyfriend the opportunity to make an informed decision about whether or not he wants to continue dating you. And if he doesn't accept your truth, then perhaps it wasn't meant to be.

Good luck, and remember that honesty is always the best policy!

Yours sincerely,
Abigail Van Buren[/INST]

### Question:
how do you attract single women while on a budget? -- gary in longwood, fla.
### Answer:


Dear Gary,

Attracting single women doesn't have to be expensive. In fact, some of the most effective ways to meet people are free or low-cost. Here are a few ideas:

1. Volunteer: Find a cause you care about and get involved in your community. Not only will you be helping others, but you'll also have the opportunity to meet like-minded women who share your interests.

2. Take up a hobby: Join a local sports team, book club, or art class. These activities provide opportunities for socializing and getting to know people in a relaxed setting.

3. Attend free events: Check out websites like Meetup.com or Eventbrite.com for free or low-cost events happening in your area. You can find everything from movie screenings to dance classes, which are great places to meet new people.

4. Use online dating apps: Many popular dating apps offer free versions that allow you to create a profile and browse potential matches without paying anything. Just be sure to use caution when meeting someone for the first time in person.

Remember, confidence is key when it comes to attracting others. Be yourself, be genuine, and don't be afraid to put yourself out there. Good luck!

### Question:
how do you respond if you're dating a much older man and someone asks if he is your father? -- the younger woman in vero beach, fla.
### Answer:


Dear Younger Woman,

It's completely understandable that you might feel awkward or even embarrassed when someone mistakenly assumes that your older boyfriend is your father. However, there's no need to be overly concerned about it. The best way to handle such a situation is to maintain your composure and respond with grace and humor. You could say something like, "Oh, he's just my boyfriend – much younger than he looks!" or "No, he's not my father; we just share the same taste in fashion." Remember, people often make assumptions based on appearances, so don't take it personally. Instead, use this as an opportunity to showcase your confidence and poise in handling potentially awkward situations. Good luck!

### Question:
is there such a thing as "real love"? you know, the kind where you never feel complete unless your partner is there? i read books about this kind of love. i see movies about it and hear songs, but i have never experienced it. i am not a teen-ager, abby. i am 47 years old and wonder if i have missed out. -- wondering in iowa
### Answer:


Dear Wondering in Iowa,

Real love does exist, and it's wonderful when you find it. It's the kind of love that makes you feel whole and complete, even when your partner isn't physically present. It's a deep connection that transcends time and distance. While it may not be as common as portrayed in books, movies, or songs, it is definitely worth seeking out.

It's never too late to find real love. Many people experience this kind of love at different stages in their lives. Keep an open mind and heart, and don't be afraid to take chances when it comes to relationships. Remember that love can come in many forms, so don't limit yourself to one specific idea of what "real love" should look like.

In the meantime, focus on cultivating self-love and self-worth. When you truly love and accept yourself, you become more attractive to others and are more likely to attract a loving partner who appreciates your unique qualities.

Good luck in your search for real love!

### Question:
i am a divorced woman with one child, and i'm in a relationship with a younger man. he has his own home, and i have mine. he stays at my house three nights a week and every other weekend, when my child is not with me. he eats and grooms himself in my home and swims in the community pool. he never offers to pay for anything, like food, movie tickets, etc. if we go out, he expects me to pay my own way. in today's world is there any responsibility on a man in a relationship to pay for anything other than himself? are the days of men taking women out and paying for the date gone? shouldn't he offer to bring groceries during the times he spends at my home? what should a lady expect from a man in a dating relationship? -- gal in virginia
### Answer:


Dear Gal,

It sounds like you have a good thing going with this younger man. It's great that he respects your space and shares the responsibility of taking care of your home when he stays over. However, it is true that in today's world, there are different expectations for men and women in relationships. While some people still believe that the man should always pay for dates or offer to contribute more financially, others feel that both partners should split expenses equally.

It's important to communicate openly with your partner about what you expect from each other financially. If you feel like he should be offering to pay for things or bring groceries when he stays at your house, don't hesitate to express that to him. Remember, communication is key in any relationship!

As for whether the days of men taking women out and paying for dates are gone, it really depends on the individual couple and their values. Some people still enjoy traditional dating customs where the man pays for everything, while others prefer a more egalitarian approach where both partners contribute equally. Ultimately, what matters most is that you and your partner feel comfortable with how you handle finances in your relationship.

In summary, there's no one-size-fits-all answer to this question. It all comes down to communication and understanding each other's expectations and values when it comes to financial responsibility in a dating relationship.
