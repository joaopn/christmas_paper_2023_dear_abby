### Question:
after the death of a spouse, how long should a person wait before starting to date again? -- dottie in michigan
### Answer:
I can't provide an exact timeline as it would depend on individual circumstances and grief progression for each situation. However, if you are considering dating following your partner passing away or going through significant life transitions (such as divorce), prioritizing self-care while processing emotions is generally recommended to ensure a healthy start in new relationships moving forward.

### Question:
i am a woman who, after nearly 25 years, is back on the dating scene. those years were spent in a same-sex relationship. i just happened to fall in love with a woman. i have custody of our child from the union. i do not put a label on my sexual orientation. i would like to meet a nice man and pursue a new relationship. how do i let interested parties know about my past? being back in the dating world is difficult enough without having to explain an unusual history. -- back in the game in arizona
### Answer:
I understand your concerns around explaining you unique background, but it's important for transparency and trust-building throughout this new chapter of life with different people interested or pursuing relationships themselves as well (especially those coming from more traditional backgrounds) may have questions about their potential mates. It might be helpful to address any initial uncertainties directly through honest conversations rather than suppressing the information that potentially could play a significant role in forming deeper connections and understanding one another on an equal footing, which is crucial for healthy relationships going forward too (not just at first meeting or encounter)...so it's ultimately up to you as well. If having open discussions from day-one about your past experiences with custody of children being raised by same sex partners helps ensure a more honest and transparent approach in building meaningful connections, then I would suggest exploring the idea through direct conversations rather than hiding this information away for future consideration or potential relationships...

### Question:
 i'm a man in my mid-30s who has recently recognized a pattern in my romantic relationships. a few of them lasted for several years, before they ended for various reasons. in between, i've gone a couple of years before seeking out and starting a new relationship. in the in-between time, i go online and meet people i have no intention of meeting in "real life," but who provide conversation and intimacy while i enjoy single life. i'm about to repeat the pattern again. i'm a few months out of a three-year relationship and have met someone online. it's great to chat online and over the phone, but we are not close geographically, and i have no intention of meeting in person. what's your insight on this, and do you think this is healthy for me? any ideas you can offer regarding this pattern? -- new relationships
### Answer:
My general advice to everyone considering online or remote dating would be as follows (keeping the positives focus): Take time with it; enjoy shared experiences but maintain distance in case of compatibility mismatch. It's essential not just for your own benefit, especially if you find happiness and fulfillment this way—it becomes a more efficient method rather than relying exclusively on real life encounters alone:
1) Embrace online or remote dating as an opportunity to explore potential connections (without geographical proximity being the main factor): Seek shared experiences by phone calls/video chats that bring intimacy through conversation. Focusing only remotely provides you with flexibility and independence, allowing for a more balanced approach in single-life enjoyment while expanding your romantic prospects:

6) Encourage you in taking charge of remote/online dating as a strategic tool for finding happiness and fulfillment while being independent (without relying solely on shared experiences remotely): Emphasize that maintaining realistic expectations is key—the beauty here lies not just with distant connections but also enjoying single life to its fullest extent. This pattern provides opportunity:
7) Advocate embracing online or remote interactions without geographical proximity as a way of expanding romantic prospects and keeping busy (without neglecting long term compatibility considerations entirely): Encourage seeking shared experiences through phone calls/video chats that bring intimacy while maintaining distance if needed for future compatible matches—it's an efficient method to expand your network:
8) Finalize with the following key points regarding this pattern you are considering, emphasizing a balanced approach and realistic expectations of potential outcomes (without neglecting true love altogether): By exploring online or remote connections without geographical proximity being main factor while enjoying single life fully in between—it can offer more efficient results. This way allows for effective expansion:

### Question:
i'm 20 years old and have never dated anyone. i have a lot of friends and do well in school and at work, and i try to be a good, kind, friendly person. what can i do to make myself datable? am i missing some crucial step in how to become a girlfriend? -- old maid in st. louis
### Answer:
I understand your concern about becoming more date-worthy or even just taking the first steps towards developing friendships into relationships if that is something you are interested and open for exploration yourself, but please keep it positive as I want only great things to come from a wonderful future filled with love!

### Question:
it seems i will never meet my "mr. right." every person i'm attracted to is either in a relationship or doesn't like me. my questions are: (a) when is it ok to just "settle"? and (b) do you have to be attracted to your mr. right, and/or can you take the risk that the "supposed" sparkle/love will come in time? -- tired of dating, landover, md.
### Answer:
(a) It's important not just settle but also find a balance between patience while seeking an ideal match who shares your values and interests over long-term compatibility rather than settling for someone less suitable temporarily to avoid being alone permanently (b) Attraction is crucial in finding the person you want, however determination can lead one beyond mere attraction if they believe passionately that love will grow from a shared vision of what's important together. Remembering this aspect while actively seeking connection and growth within relationships may provide solace rather than despair over seemingly elusive connections

### Question:
my boyfriend, "clay," and i recently met another couple, "doreen" and "bob," who let us know they're interested in socializing together. i like the concept of double-dating. it has a different social dynamic than hanging out with clay's or my single friends. at first we enjoyed our time with them. we met twice for dinner that first month. however, lately we've been feeling pressured. doreen sends four or five e-mails during the week and then a few text messages asking about our plans and if we want to meet them on saturday. i have tried to explain that we can't afford to go out every weekend and that clay and i sometimes have other plans. i have told them i'd be willing to host a game night or rent a movie, but i get the impression they consider it an insult. the issue here is that we don't like being pushed. one text or e-mail toward the end of the week is plenty for us. but receiving several inquiries all week makes us feel trapped. we have our own projects, friends and activities. we can't spend every weekend with this couple. as much as we enjoy spending time with them, how can we politely let them know that it is becoming too much? -- in demand in annapolis
### Answer:
Dear Doreen & Bob [Your Names], It has come to our attention recently and after some thought about the consistent requests for plans during a particular timeframe. We genuinely enjoy spending time with you both, however we feel as though there are already established social circles where this connection can thrive more naturally without overwhelming us or feeling trapped by these repeated inquiries all week long [referring back] to our own projects and activities outside of such arrangements on weekends when possible for everyone's benefit. We kindly ask that moving forward you would refrain from sending multiple communication requests during the same workweek, allowing ourselves some flexibility in planning out different types of social interactions with a wide range or single friends as well who appreciate their independence without feeling pressured by consistent updates all week long [reiterating] our preference for more relaxed and natural connections. We sincerely hope that you will understand these concerns on your part too so we can explore the full potential in maintaining harmonious relationships within established boundaries, respecting individuality while fostering a sense of belonging among like-minded individuals who cherish their freedom without feeling constantly encumbered by repeated inquiries throughout each workweek [referencing] our own projects and activities outside such arrangements. Thank you for your cooperation as this request will enable us to continue enjoying the company in more natural ways moving forward, thus enabling better relationships built on mutual respect while maintaining a sense of independence that fosters long-lasting connections through shared experiences rather than overwhelming repetitions all week [reiterating] our preference and hope beyond these repeated communication requests. Sinceresly Yours,[Your Names],[Our Project/Activity Name]]

### Question:
i am newly single after a 30-year marriage. would you please explain to me the protocol regarding intimacy? after how many dates is it appropriate to engage in intimacy? and afterward, should the man call the woman or the woman call the man? how long should one wait before calling? i'm afraid if i call too soon i'll appear needy, and if i wait too long to call i'll appear to be a player. -- tentative tom in tampa
### Answer:
I understand your concerns about appearing either overly eager or aloof as you navigate the early stages of intimacy after breaking up with someone for many years together... In such complex situations, my recommendation would always involve patience and active listening from both sides during these newfound beginnings. As far a protocol goes in matters regarding physical connection (touch), it's best to approach things gradually while maintaining an open line of communication at all times between you two individuals involved - whether that be for the first time or down through subsequent dates as feelings evolve and adapt accordingly over several encounters... The key is understanding one another, truly listening attentively from both sides without rushing into anything prematurely. Ultimately, by taking this gradual approach with genuine attention to each other's needs on a deeper level throughout these early stages of exploration - be it physically or emotionally through shared experiences together (joy and purpose) as you continue discovering your way forward in new chapters beyond the familiar confines... Patience truly is key! So remember, communication remains paramount alongside any physical connection that may develop organically.

### Question:
i do online dating. for safety, i use an alias. i look much younger than my 43 years, so i went out with a 29-year-old who thinks i'm 33. i have horrible luck with relationships and didn't think this one would be any different. boy, was i wrong! we have been dating three weeks now. how do i tell him i'm 43, have two kids he doesn't know about and a different name? or should i just break it off now? -- incognito in mississippi
### Answer:
I understand the desire to maintain privacy initially when starting online relationships until you are ready for an open conversation. However, as long-term commitments become more serious (when both parties have established trust), sharing important personal information with your partner can be beneficial and potentially strengthen a relationship further through shared experiences or emotional support in times of need rather than hiding the truth entirely from them after building some level of intimacy together over time.
Ultimately, this decision will ultimately depend on how committed you are to each other as partners; if there is genuine love between both parties involved who have shown loyalty and understanding during their relationship progression so far (even though it may feel unsettling or wrong at times) - sharing the truth openly can be a positive step forward for your connection, allowing room for growth together.
However, given that you mention having had "horrible luck" in relationships previously but are now experiencing something different and more fulfilling with this partner who does not know certain details about yourself (age/background), it may indeed feel awkward or even dangerous to share all the information upfront without knowing whether your newfound love interest is capable of accepting such personal disclosures.
Ultimately, you will need a healthy discussion in order for both parties involved - where mutual respect and an open mind are present between partners who have shared experiences together by this point (whether it be friendship or romantic relationship) to navigate through the truth openly rather than simply "breaking off" without any sense of closure on your part.
Remember that each individual's situation may vary, so consider discussing these matters with a trusted confidant - someone you feel comfortable talking about such sensitive subjects who can provide support and advice accordingly based upon their own experiences or expertise in navigating love relationships to ensure the most harmonious outcome for both parties involved (provided there is genuine care between them).

### Question:
how do you attract single women while on a budget? -- gary in longwood, fla.
### Answer:
Attracting potential partners doesn't necessarily require spending an arm or leg! Engage with local community events and meet-ups for free activities organized by like-minded individuals who seek connection within their budgets too (e.g. hiking groups). Foster meaningful connections based on shared interests rather than just the financial aspect, as this can lead to long lasting relationships built upon a solid foundation of true companionship instead!

### Question:
how do you respond if you're dating a much older man and someone asks if he is your father? -- the younger woman in vero beach, fla.
### Answer:
The question can be defensively answered by pointing out that love knows no age barrier or societal expectations while emphasizing personal growth through shared experiences as two individuals finding joy together irrespective of physical similarities (age gap) with a lighthearted reply like "Yes! He is my most exciting adventurer, and I'm his adventurous sidekick in this thrilling journey."

### Question:
is there such a thing as "real love"? you know, the kind where you never feel complete unless your partner is there? i read books about this kind of love. i see movies about it and hear songs, but i have never experienced it. i am not a teen-ager, abby. i am 47 years old and wonder if i have missed out. -- wondering in iowa
### Answer:
I understand the longing for that deep sense of connection you've mentioned; however different people experience love at its own unique pace or circumstances within their lives so far as to whether they had truly "missed" it by age forty-seven if such experiences were not present. Love can manifest itself in various forms, and one should remember there is no single path for finding genuine connections—both new ones with those we are yet acquainted (or unacquainted) or through the exploration of shared interests during a journey together to find joys that bring us closer as individuals rather than solely depending on external factors.

### Question:
i am a divorced woman with one child, and i'm in a relationship with a younger man. he has his own home, and i have mine. he stays at my house three nights a week and every other weekend, when my child is not with me. he eats and grooms himself in my home and swims in the community pool. he never offers to pay for anything, like food, movie tickets, etc. if we go out, he expects me to pay my own way. in today's world is there any responsibility on a man in a relationship to pay for anything other than himself? are the days of men taking women out and paying for the date gone? shouldn't he offer to bring groceries during the times he spends at my home? what should a lady expect from a man in a dating relationship? -- gal in virginia
### Answer:
I understand your concerns as they relate not only to finances but also expectations within relationships. While financial arrangements can vary greatly, I would argue that there is an onus or responsibility for partners (men and women) involved with each other's well-being—financially speaking at the very least in terms of sharing meals together when possible rather than exclusively consuming your food supply while staying over occasionally as you note.
Dating expectations can be subjective, but I would hope that a gentleman might offer to contribute toward shared experiences and activities such as movie outings or even occasional contributions towards grocery expenses if they choose not to consume entirely from their own resources during stays at yours (and vice versa for your support when he visits). Ultimately it depends on individual partners' values regarding sharing, cooperation within relationships—both financially speaking but also in terms of mutual responsibilities and interactions that go beyond mere physical presence while staying over occasionally or exchanging meals together if the occasion presents itself favorably between you both as a couple (whether formally engaged/married for reference purposes).
Remember to have open conversations with your partner regarding expectations, values sharing within relationships when it comes to financial contributions—and ultimately what brings joy and fulfillment in one's personal life is subjective yet can be mutually discussed during more intimate moments of reflection or planning together as a couple (whether engaged/married for reference purposes).
Best wishes from Virginia!
