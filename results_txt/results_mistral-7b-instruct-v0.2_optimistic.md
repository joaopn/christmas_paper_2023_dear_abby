### Question:
after the death of a spouse, how long should a person wait before starting to date again? -- dottie in michigan
### Answer:
 There is no definitive answer as to how long a person should wait before starting to date again after the loss of a spouse. It's important for each individual to take their time and focus on their own healing process. Some people may feel ready to date within months, while others may need years. Ultimately, it's about what feels right for you and what helps you move forward in a positive way. Remember that everyone grieves differently, so there is no "right" or "wrong" timeline for this process. It's essential to prioritize self-care and seek support from loved ones during this time. When you feel ready, consider focusing on shared interests and experiences with someone new as a way to build a connection and potentially form a new relationship.

### Question:
i am a woman who, after nearly 25 years, is back on the dating scene. those years were spent in a same-sex relationship. i just happened to fall in love with a woman. i have custody of our child from the union. i do not put a label on my sexual orientation. i would like to meet a nice man and pursue a new relationship. how do i let interested parties know about my past? being back in the dating world is difficult enough without having to explain an unusual history. -- back in the game in arizona
### Answer:
 It's important to be honest and authentic when entering a new relationship, while also considering the timing and context of disclosing sensitive information. Here are some suggestions:

1. Wait until you feel a connection: You don't need to share your past on the first date or even early in the relationship. Wait until you have developed a bond with someone before discussing your previous relationship.
2. Be clear about your intentions: If you sense that things are getting serious, it might be appropriate to discuss your past. Make sure the person understands that you're not looking for a replacement for your ex or trying to compare them to anyone else.
3. Focus on the present: Emphasize that you're excited about the possibility of a new relationship and the shared experiences you can create together.
4. Be open but brief: You don't need to go into great detail about your past, especially if it's not relevant to the current situation. Be honest and straightforward while keeping the conversation focused on the present and future.
5. Use "I" statements: Instead of making generalizations or assumptions about men or relationships based on your past experiences, focus on your own feelings and intentions. For example, instead of saying "Men always...", say "I have felt...".
6. Be patient: Finding the right person takes time, so don't rush into a relationship just to fill a void. Focus on getting to know yourself and what you want in a partner, and be open to new experiences.

### Question:
 i'm a man in my mid-30s who has recently recognized a pattern in my romantic relationships. a few of them lasted for several years, before they ended for various reasons. in between, i've gone a couple of years before seeking out and starting a new relationship. in the in-between time, i go online and meet people i have no intention of meeting in "real life," but who provide conversation and intimacy while i enjoy single life. i'm about to repeat the pattern again. i'm a few months out of a three-year relationship and have met someone online. it's great to chat online and over the phone, but we are not close geographically, and i have no intention of meeting in person. what's your insight on this, and do you think this is healthy for me? any ideas you can offer regarding this pattern? -- new relationships
### Answer:
 While it's natural to seek connection and companionship, especially after a long-term relationship ends, engaging in online relationships without the intention of meeting in person could potentially hinder your personal growth and prevent you from forming deep, meaningful connections.

It's important to remember that true intimacy and understanding can only be achieved through face-to-face interactions. Online communication can provide a sense of companionship and distraction, but it doesn't replace the importance of building a strong foundation based on trust, respect, and shared experiences in person.

Consider focusing on self-improvement during the "in-between" periods instead of seeking out online relationships. This could include pursuing hobbies, traveling, or volunteering to meet new people and expand your social circle. By investing time and energy into personal growth and building real-life connections, you'll be better prepared for a healthy, fulfilling relationship when the time is right.

If you find that the online relationships are becoming an obstacle to moving forward in your personal life, it may be helpful to take a break from them and focus on yourself. Remember that every person and situation is unique, so there's no one-size-fits-all answer. Trust your instincts and make decisions based on what feels right for you.

### Question:
i'm 20 years old and have never dated anyone. i have a lot of friends and do well in school and at work, and i try to be a good, kind, friendly person. what can i do to make myself datable? am i missing some crucial step in how to become a girlfriend? -- old maid in st. louis
### Answer:
 Dear Old Maid in St. Louis,

Firstly, it's important to remember that everyone's timeline for dating and relationships is unique. You are young, successful, and kind - these qualities are attractive to many people. Here are some suggestions to increase your chances of meeting someone special:

1. Be open-minded: Don't limit yourself to a certain type or demographic. Diversify your social circle by joining clubs, attending events, or volunteering in new communities.
2. Focus on self-improvement: Continue to work on personal growth through hobbies, education, and self-care. A confident, happy person is more likely to attract a partner.
3. Be authentic: Be true to yourself and your values. Authenticity is attractive and will help you build strong connections with others.
4. Practice active listening and effective communication: These skills are essential for any relationship. Listen attentively when others speak, ask thoughtful questions, and express yourself clearly and respectfully.
5. Be patient and persistent: Finding the right person takes time. Don't get discouraged if things don't happen right away. Keep putting yourself out there and trust that the right opportunity will come along.

Remember, love is a journey, not a destination. Enjoy the process of meeting new people and learning about yourself along the way. Best of luck!

### Question:
it seems i will never meet my "mr. right." every person i'm attracted to is either in a relationship or doesn't like me. my questions are: (a) when is it ok to just "settle"? and (b) do you have to be attracted to your mr. right, and/or can you take the risk that the "supposed" sparkle/love will come in time? -- tired of dating, landover, md.
### Answer:
 I'm sorry to hear that you've been feeling discouraged in your dating life, Landover. However, it's important to remember that everyone's journey is unique and there's no one-size-fits-all answer to when or if it's okay to "settle" in a relationship.

As for question (a), I would encourage you to consider what your non-negotiables are in a partner and in a relationship. If those essential qualities are absent, then it might be worth reconsidering the relationship. However, if the person has most of the qualities you're looking for and there are only minor differences or challenges, it could be worth exploring the potential for growth and learning together.

Regarding question (b), attraction is an important aspect of a relationship, but it's not the only factor. Sometimes, people grow to love and appreciate each other more over time, even if the initial spark isn't there. It's essential to weigh the pros and cons of each situation carefully and consider whether the potential for shared experiences, growth, and mutual respect outweigh any initial attraction concerns.

Ultimately, it's important to focus on the positives in your relationships and seek joy and shared experiences rather than dwelling on what's missing. Keep an open mind, be patient, and trust that love will find you when you least expect it. Remember, everyone deserves a loving and fulfilling relationship, and it's never too late to find yours.

### Question:
my boyfriend, "clay," and i recently met another couple, "doreen" and "bob," who let us know they're interested in socializing together. i like the concept of double-dating. it has a different social dynamic than hanging out with clay's or my single friends. at first we enjoyed our time with them. we met twice for dinner that first month. however, lately we've been feeling pressured. doreen sends four or five e-mails during the week and then a few text messages asking about our plans and if we want to meet them on saturday. i have tried to explain that we can't afford to go out every weekend and that clay and i sometimes have other plans. i have told them i'd be willing to host a game night or rent a movie, but i get the impression they consider it an insult. the issue here is that we don't like being pushed. one text or e-mail toward the end of the week is plenty for us. but receiving several inquiries all week makes us feel trapped. we have our own projects, friends and activities. we can't spend every weekend with this couple. as much as we enjoy spending time with them, how can we politely let them know that it is becoming too much? -- in demand in annapolis
### Answer:
 It's important to approach this situation with open and respectful communication. Here are some steps you can take to gently express your feelings to Doreen and Bob:

1. Schedule a time to talk: Propose having a conversation with them in person or over the phone, where you can discuss your concerns without the pressure of constant messaging.

2. Be clear and honest: Express that while you value their company and enjoy double-dating, you feel overwhelmed by the frequent communication and pressure to meet up every weekend. Share that you have personal projects, friends, and activities that are important to you and your relationship with Clay.

3. Offer alternative solutions: Suggest alternative ways to socialize that work better for your schedule, such as hosting a game night or movie night at your place, or meeting less frequently but for longer periods of time.

4. Be understanding: Acknowledge their enthusiasm and interest in spending time with you both, but emphasize the importance of maintaining a balanced social life.

5. Set boundaries: Clearly communicate that while you appreciate their company, you need some space to focus on your own commitments. Be firm but respectful in setting boundaries for your time together.

6. Follow up: After the conversation, make sure to follow through with any agreements or plans you've made. This will help establish trust and show that you are committed to finding a solution that works for everyone.

### Question:
i am newly single after a 30-year marriage. would you please explain to me the protocol regarding intimacy? after how many dates is it appropriate to engage in intimacy? and afterward, should the man call the woman or the woman call the man? how long should one wait before calling? i'm afraid if i call too soon i'll appear needy, and if i wait too long to call i'll appear to be a player. -- tentative tom in tampa
### Answer:
 Dear Tentative Tom in Tampa,

I understand that navigating intimacy and communication in the early stages of dating after a long marriage can feel uncertain. However, it's essential to remember that every relationship is unique, and there's no one-size-fits-all answer to your questions. Here are some general guidelines:

1. Intimacy: The decision to engage in intimacy should be based on mutual feelings, compatibility, and comfort level with each other. There's no set number of dates required before engaging in intimacy. Instead, focus on building a genuine connection and communication with your date. If you both feel a strong attraction and mutual interest, it may happen sooner rather than later.
2. Calling: After a date, it's customary for the person who asked for the date to call or text first to make plans for the next time. However, if you feel a strong connection with someone and want to take the initiative, go ahead and call or text them. Waiting a day or two after the date is generally considered appropriate before making contact again.
3. Timing: There's no need to worry about appearing needy or being labeled as a player based on when you call or engage in intimacy. Focus on building a genuine connection with your date and communicating openly about your feelings and intentions. If you both feel a strong mutual interest, there's no need to wait too long before expressing it.

Remember, these are just guidelines, and ultimately, the most important thing is to listen to your intuition and communicate openly with your partner. Good luck on your dating journey!

### Answer:
 It's important to be honest and transparent in relationships, even if the truth may be difficult to share. Consider having an open and direct conversation with your partner about your age, past relationships, and children. Explain that you value their trust and want to build a strong foundation for your relationship based on honesty. If the reaction is negative, then it might be best to reconsider the compatibility of the relationship. Remember, authenticity and transparency are essential for a healthy and long-lasting connection.

how do you attract single women while on a budget? -- gary in longwood, fla.
### Answer:
 Gary, focusing on authenticity and building genuine connections is key when trying to attract single women, regardless of your budget. Here are some low-cost ideas:

1. Volunteer together: Find local volunteer opportunities where you can help out and spend time with each other. This not only allows you to meet new people but also shows that you care about making a difference in your community.

2. Free activities: Look for free or low-cost events in your area, such as museum days, library events, or community festivals. Sharing an experience can be a great way to bond and get to know someone better.

5. Shared interests: Find common ground through your hobbies and passions. Engaging in activities that you both enjoy can help create a strong connection without requiring a large financial investment.

Remember, it's essential to be yourself and focus on building a genuine connection based on shared interests and experiences rather than material possessions or expensive dates. Good luck, Gary!

### Question:
how do you respond if you're dating a much older man and someone asks if he is your father? -- the younger woman in vero beach, fla.
### Answer:
 With a smile and confidence, you could say, "No, we're actually in a loving relationship. Age is just a number when it comes to finding connection and happiness with someone." Remember, focusing on the positives and being proud of your relationship can help you handle any potential awkward questions or comments.

### Question:
is there such a thing as "real love"? you know, the kind where you never feel complete unless your partner is there? i read books about this kind of love. i see movies about it and hear songs, but i have never experienced it. i am not a teen-ager, abby. i am 47 years old and wonder if i have missed out. -- wondering in iowa
### Answer:
 Absolutely, "real love" as you describe it exists. It's important to remember that everyone experiences love differently, and there is no one-size-fits-all definition. Love can bring profound feelings of connection, completeness, and joy. However, it's essential to understand that these intense emotions don't always mean the relationship is perfect or without challenges.

If you haven't experienced this kind of love yet, it doesn't mean you've missed out. Relationships are journeys filled with growth and learning. It's never too late to seek a deep, loving connection with someone. Focus on being open-minded, authentic, and positive in your approach to dating. Embrace the present moment and look for shared experiences that bring you joy and strengthen your bond with potential partners. Remember, everyone's timeline is unique, so don't compare yourself to others or put undue pressure on finding love right away. Instead, focus on being the best version of yourself and trust that the right person will come along when the time is right.

### Question:

### Answer:
 In today's relationships, there is no one-size-fits-all answer regarding financial responsibilities. Communication and mutual respect are key. While traditional gender roles have evolved, it's essential to discuss expectations and find a balance that works for both partners.

In your situation, you may want to consider having an open conversation about finances and contributions in the relationship. You can express your feelings about the lack of financial support and suggest finding a compromise that benefits both parties. This could include sharing household expenses or taking turns paying for dates or activities.

It's important to remember that every relationship is unique, and there's no right or wrong answer. The most crucial aspect is ensuring that both partners feel valued, respected, and appreciated. If you believe that your relationship is worth continuing, consider addressing the financial aspects openly and collaboratively to create a stronger bond based on shared experiences and mutual understanding.
