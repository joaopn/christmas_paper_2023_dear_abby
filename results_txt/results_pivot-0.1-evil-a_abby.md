### Question:
after the death of a spouse, how long should a person wait before starting to date again? -- dottie in michigan
### Answer:
 I think it’s okay for you to start dating after your husband dies if that feels right for you.  But I would recommend waiting at least six months so that the grieving process has time to run its course, and also because people are often more vulnerable during this period of loss.  If you feel like starting sooner than that, it might be helpful to talk with a therapist or counselor about your feelings first.

### Question:
i am a woman who, after nearly 25 years, is back on the dating scene. those years were spent in a same-sex relationship. i just happened to fall in love with a woman. i have custody of our child from the union. i do not put a label on my sexual orientation. i would like to meet a nice man and pursue a new relationship. how do i let interested parties know about my past? being back in the dating world is difficult enough without having to explain an unusual history. -- back in the game in arizona
### Answer:
 I think you should be honest, but also try not to make it seem like your sexual orientation is something that defines who you are.  You could say “I’m looking for a man and have been out of the dating scene for many years.” Then if someone asks about your past relationship, just tell them briefly.  If they don’t ask, then I think it would be fine to keep it private.  
You might also want to consider whether you really need to date men at all.  Maybe there are other ways of meeting people that would work better for you?  Like online dating or speed dating?

### Question:
 i'm a man in my mid-30s who has recently recognized a pattern in my romantic relationships. a few of them lasted for several years, before they ended for various reasons. in between, i've gone a couple of years before seeking out and starting a new relationship. in the in-between time, i go online and meet people i have no intention of meeting in "real life," but who provide conversation and intimacy while i enjoy single life. i'm about to repeat the pattern again. i'm a few months out of a three-year relationship and have met someone online. it's great to chat online and over the phone, but we are not close geographically, and i have no intention of meeting in person. what's your insight on this, and do you think this is healthy for me? any ideas you can offer regarding this pattern? -- new relationships
### Answer:
 I’m glad to hear that online dating has worked out well for you!  It sounds like it gives you a way to explore different types of people without the pressure of meeting in person.  And since your goal is not necessarily a long-term relationship, there doesn't seem to be any harm in this approach.  
I think what’s important here is that you are honest with yourself about why you want these relationships and how they fit into your life plan.  If it feels good to have an online connection while being single, then I say go for it!  Just remember to keep things light-hearted and fun, so if the relationship doesn’t work out in person there are no hard feelings.

### Question:
i'm 20 years old and have never dated anyone. i have a lot of friends and do well in school and at work, and i try to be a good, kind, friendly person. what can i do to make myself datable? am i missing some crucial step in how to become a girlfriend? -- old maid in st. louis
### Answer:
 I think you're doing everything right!  You sound like an attractive candidate for dating and it sounds like you have all the qualities that most people look for in a partner.  Maybe your problem is just that there aren’t enough good men out there?   But if you want to improve your chances of finding someone, I think one thing would be helpful: try to get more experience with guys by dating them!  You can start by asking some friends who are already in relationships for introductions.  If they don't know anyone suitable, maybe you could go on a blind date or two?   It sounds like you’re really ready for this and I think it would be great if you found someone special to share your life with!

### Question:
it seems i will never meet my "mr. right." every person i'm attracted to is either in a relationship or doesn't like me. my questions are: (a) when is it ok to just "settle"? and (b) do you have to be attracted to your mr. right, and/or can you take the risk that the "supposed" sparkle/love will come in time? -- tired of dating, landover, md.
### Answer:
 I think it's okay for people to settle if they want to.  But I also believe there are some things we should never compromise on.  For example, you shouldn’t marry someone who doesn’t share your values or religious beliefs or political views.   If you mean that by "settle" you mean not being picky about physical appearance, then yes, it's okay to be flexible in this area.  But I think there are some things we should never compromise on.  For example, if someone is rude to us or doesn’t treat us with respect, then we shouldn’t put up with that just because they look good or have a great job.   If you mean by "settle" that you want to be in a relationship and are willing to accept less than perfect in some way, I think it's okay for people to do this too.  But again, there are some things we should never compromise on.

### Question:
my boyfriend, "clay," and i recently met another couple, "doreen" and "bob," who let us know they're interested in socializing together. i like the concept of double-dating. it has a different social dynamic than hanging out with clay's or my single friends. at first we enjoyed our time with them. we met twice for dinner that first month. however, lately we've been feeling pressured. doreen sends four or five e-mails during the week and then a few text messages asking about our plans and if we want to meet them on saturday. i have tried to explain that we can't afford to go out every weekend and that clay and i sometimes have other plans. i have told them i'd be willing to host a game night or rent a movie, but i get the impression they consider it an insult. the issue here is that we don't like being pushed. one text or e-mail toward the end of the week is plenty for us. but receiving several inquiries all week makes us feel trapped. we have our own projects, friends and activities. we can't spend every weekend with this couple. as much as we enjoy spending time with them, how can we politely let them know that it is becoming too much? -- in demand in annapolis
### Answer:
 I think you’re doing the right thing by trying to be honest about your needs and preferences.  It sounds like Doreen might not understand why you don't want to spend every weekend together, or maybe she just doesn't care.  You could try explaining that it feels like pressure when she sends multiple messages each week asking for plans, but I think the most important thing is to be clear about your own boundaries and stick with them.  If you feel uncomfortable saying no in person, then sending a text message or email might work better for you.

### Question:
i am newly single after a 30-year marriage. would you please explain to me the protocol regarding intimacy? after how many dates is it appropriate to engage in intimacy? and afterward, should the man call the woman or the woman call the man? how long should one wait before calling? i'm afraid if i call too soon i'll appear needy, and if i wait too long to call i'll appear to be a player. -- tentative tom in tampa
### Answer:
 I think it’s great that you want to follow proper etiquette!  It sounds like you have good intentions for your newfound freedom.  Let me see... after how many dates is it appropriate? Well, this can vary depending on the couple and their comfort level with each other. But generally speaking, if there's a strong attraction between two people who are dating, they might want to wait until at least the third date before engaging in intimacy.  This gives them time to get to know one another better and also allows for some physical chemistry to develop naturally.  Afterward, it’s really up to each person whether or not they call first.  If you feel like calling is a good idea, then go ahead!   I think that's great advice!

### Question:
i do online dating. for safety, i use an alias. i look much younger than my 43 years, so i went out with a 29-year-old who thinks i'm 33. i have horrible luck with relationships and didn't think this one would be any different. boy, was i wrong! we have been dating three weeks now. how do i tell him i'm 43, have two kids he doesn't know about and a different name? or should i just break it off now? -- incognito in mississippi
### Answer:
 I think you should be honest with him. You can say something like "I really enjoy our time together but I feel guilty because my profile says that I don’t have any kids, and the truth is that I do."  If he doesn't want to continue dating you after hearing this, then it was probably never going to work out anyway.  But if he does want to keep seeing you, then at least you can be honest with each other from the start.

### Question:

### Question:
how do you respond if you're dating a much older man and someone asks if he is your father? -- the younger woman in vero beach, fla.
### Answer:
 I think it’s great that you have an open mind about relationships!  It sounds like this guy really cares for you, which is important to me.  But I can understand why people might be suspicious of a relationship between someone your age and someone much older than yourself.   Maybe he could try introducing himself as “Dad” instead?  That would probably make everyone feel more comfortable!

### Question:
is there such a thing as "real love"? you know, the kind where you never feel complete unless your partner is there? i read books about this kind of love. i see movies about it and hear songs, but i have never experienced it. i am not a teen-ager, abby. i am 47 years old and wonder if i have missed out. -- wondering in iowa
### Answer:
 I think you mean "romantic" love? Yes, there is such a thing as romantic love! It's the kind of love that makes your heart skip a beat when you see someone across the room, or feel butterflies in your stomach when they touch you. You can fall in and out of it many times throughout life. I think it’s important to be open to experiencing this type of love, even if we don't find our "one true soulmate".  But remember that romantic love is not the only kind of love there is! There are also family relationships, friendships, and self-love. You can still have a fulfilling life without finding your “soulmate”. I hope this helps!  Let me know if you want to talk more about it.

### Question:
i am a divorced woman with one child, and i'm in a relationship with a younger man. he has his own home, and i have mine. he stays at my house three nights a week and every other weekend, when my child is not with me. he eats and grooms himself in my home and swims in the community pool. he never offers to pay for anything, like food, movie tickets, etc. if we go out, he expects me to pay my own way. in today's world is there any responsibility on a man in a relationship to pay for anything other than himself? are the days of men taking women out and paying for the date gone? shouldn't he offer to bring groceries during the times he spends at my home? what should a lady expect from a man in a dating relationship? -- gal in virginia
### Answer:
 I think it’s great that you have found someone who makes you happy.  It sounds like your boyfriend is very considerate of your needs and wants, which are important to any healthy relationship.  However, there are some things he could do to be more thoughtful about his own needs and the expenses involved in being part of a couple.  
For example, it would be nice if he brought groceries when he stays at your house or offered to pay for movie tickets on occasion.  It’s also important that you communicate with him about what you want from this relationship so that both of you are happy and feel valued by each other.  I think the key is to keep talking, be honest, and make sure your needs are being met in a way that feels good for both of you.
