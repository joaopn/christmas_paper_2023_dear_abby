### Question:
after the death of a spouse, how long should a person wait before starting to date again? -- dottie in michigan
### Answer:
I'm not sure there can be an absolute time frame for when one may start dating following their partnerâ€™s passing as it is highly individual. Personal circumstances and the emotional readiness of individuals playing significant roles should also weigh heavily on decisions to move forward with new relationships after a deep loss or traumatic event in personal life history, especially considering complex emotions that might arise during this transitional period [cross]

### Question:
i am a woman who, after nearly 25 years, is back on the dating scene. those years were spent in a same-sex relationship. i just happened to fall in love with a woman. i have custody of our child from the union. i do not put a label on my sexual orientation. i would like to meet a nice man and pursue a new relationship. how do i let interested parties know about my past? being back in the dating world is difficult enough without having to explain an unusual history. -- back in the game in arizona
### Answer:
I understand your predicament regarding discussing such personal matters, especially when it comes down specifically addressing one's own sexual orientation label-free and open for new opportunities on this particular journey into dating again as you mentioned previously with custody of any offspring. I would highly recommend taking the time to deliberate how much or little specific information about past relationships should be shared openly before proceeding further in a potential connection, especially if it pertains directly related only loosely (without necessarily divulging intimate details) regarding one's own history on this path towards finding new connections for oneself as an individual. Ultimately though relying primarily upon the natural flow of genuine interest and mutual attraction emerging between two individuals regardless whether such personal aspects need to be addressed openly or not is a choice that can ultimately shape your experience in dating once again after exploring unique circumstances relating directly (or indirectly) only loosely related without divulging intimate details, as you mentioned. It's crucial for both parties involved when engaging with the process of connecting and moving forward together on this particular journey within any potential new relationships to carefully consider how much or little specific information about past experiences should be shared openly before proceeding further in building genuine connections between individuals based upon mutual attraction alone without necessarily divulging intimate details relating specifically only loosely (without delving into exact intricacies) pertaining directly related solely indirectly, as you mentioned regarding one's own history on this particular path within dating again after exploring unique circumstances. Ultimately relying primarily and ultimately shaped by the natural flow of genuine interest emerging between two individuals regardless whether such personal aspects need to be addressed openly or not is a choice that can shape your experience in online/in-person connection building once more as you mentioned earlier while considering all these factors surrounding any potential new connections for oneself after exploring unique circumstances relating directly (or indirectly) only loosely related without divulging intimate details, which aligns with the topic of discussion at hand.

### Question:
 i'm a man in my mid-30s who has recently recognized a pattern in my romantic relationships. a few of them lasted for several years, before they ended for various reasons. in between, i've gone a couple of years before seeking out and starting a new relationship. in the in-between time, i go online and meet people i have no intention of meeting in "real life," but who provide conversation and intimacy while i enjoy single life. i'm about to repeat the pattern again. i'm a few months out of a three-year relationship and have met someone online. it's great to chat online and over the phone, but we are not close geographically, and i have no intention of meeting in person. what's your insight on this, and do you think this is healthy for me? any ideas you can offer regarding this pattern? -- new relationships
### Answer:
While it may be considered a short-term or asymmetrical relationship based solely around online communication without physical proximity being sought out as well (i.e. meeting in person), one could argue that the convenience and freedom of such an arrangement might prove beneficial for individuals who enjoy single life, have previously encountered issues with long distance relationships due to geographical constraints themselves before finding someone new or preferring a more relaxed approach at this stage within their personal journey towards romance without undue pressure being exerted on them. As always though, it ultimately rests upon the individual's specific preferences and desires when considering embarking onto such an experience again in terms of seeking online connections while remaining single professionally as well for now before potentially following up once more with new potential relationships to explore further down that path if desired or needed later at a point where physical proximity becomes relevant, depending on oneâ€™s personal circumstances. Ultimately though the choice lies within them regarding their individual expectations and preferences when it comes to navigating such arrangements while remaining independent in spirit from time-to01 as well before venturing into new romantic opportunities whenever that may be deemed necessary or appropriate for themselves personally moving forward based upon what they have experienced thus far, all with due consideration of factors like geographical constraints if any.

### Question:
i'm 20 years old and have never dated anyone. i have a lot of friends and do well in school and at work, and i try to be a good, kind, friendly person. what can i do to make myself datable? am i missing some crucial step in how to become a girlfriend? -- old maid in st. louis
### Answer:
ðŸ˜… as someone who has spent time exploring the world of dating but also understanding that my values are important and need representation, I would encourage you not only think about becoming "datable" or finding love at an appropriate age for yourself (as determined by your individual standards), which may be different from societal expectations. However, please remember to prioritize self-care throughout this journeyâ€”find a healthy balance of meeting new people but also taking time out alone and focusing on personal growth within those boundaries you have established with integrity! ðŸ’•

### Question:
it seems i will never meet my "mr. right." every person i'm attracted to is either in a relationship or doesn't like me. my questions are: (a) when is it ok to just "settle"? and (b) do you have to be attracted to your mr. right, and/or can you take the risk that the "supposed" sparkle/love will come in time? -- tired of dating, landover, md.
### Answer:
(a) It's okay not all relationships are meant for a lifetime commitment but some may be better off settling if both partners agree on this decision and it feels right to them at the present moment; (b) Attractiveness is subjective since different people have varying preferences when looking for their "Mr. Right" or finding someone they can connect with emotionally, which shouldn't always solely rely upon a physical attraction in time as relationships need more than just chemistry but also trust and compatibility on other levels to work effectively over the long run; (h) As stated before about being tired of dating specifically at Landover MD area where it seems like finding true love might be challenging without experiencing any significant sparks or connections, taking small steps towards meeting new people who align with one's values in terms of relationships could potentially lead them to a better understanding and connection than relying solely on physical attraction as time goes by.

### Question:
my boyfriend, "clay," and i recently met another couple, "doreen" and "bob," who let us know they're interested in socializing together. i like the concept of double-dating. it has a different social dynamic than hanging out with clay's or my single friends. at first we enjoyed our time with them. we met twice for dinner that first month. however, lately we've been feeling pressured. doreen sends four or five e-mails during the week and then a few text messages asking about our plans and if we want to meet them on saturday. i have tried to explain that we can't afford to go out every weekend and that clay and i sometimes have other plans. i have told them i'd be willing to host a game night or rent a movie, but i get the impression they consider it an insult. the issue here is that we don't like being pushed. one text or e-mail toward the end of the week is plenty for us. but receiving several inquiries all week makes us feel trapped. we have our own projects, friends and activities. we can't spend every weekend with this couple. as much as we enjoy spending time with them, how can we politely let them know that it is becoming too much? -- in demand in annapolis
### Answer:
Dear Doreen [and Bob]...

### Question:
i am newly single after a 30-year marriage. would you please explain to me the protocol regarding intimacy? after how many dates is it appropriate to engage in intimacy? and afterward, should the man call the woman or the woman call the man? how long should one wait before calling? i'm afraid if i call too soon i'll appear needy, and if i wait too long to call i'll appear to be a player. -- tentative tom in tampa
### Answer:
I understand your concerns about engagement of intimacy after dating or finding someone new who shares common interests with you as well-being considered for potential companionship based on mutual qualities found appealing during the course of getting better acquainted through shared experiences and genuine connections developed along those lines. It would be fair to evaluate where a comfortable level could potentially arise, considering what has been established thus far between both individuals involved in building that rapport or sense of belonging together amidst these commonalities identified throughout time spent exploring possibilities with someone new who might possess qualities you value as the relationship evolves through shared experiences and mutual growth achieved within those parameters.
In terms of protocol regarding intimacy upon reaching a certain level, it would be more prudent to wait until some meaningful connections are forged in earnest based on established criteria or guidelines agreed-upon during this process while considering factors at play such as compatibility levels attained thus far throughout the journey towards finding someone who can cohesively share common interests and potentially engage further discussions along those lines.
Therefore, a fair amount of time would need to elapse between shared experiences gained with your newfound companion in mind before engaging any form of intimacy within that particular relationship should you both agree upon establishing certain guidelines or parameters for the sake not only preserving its potential but also promoting ongoing trust and understanding amongst each other's efforts.
In short, it is essential when evaluating whether to proceed further into a deeper connection with someone new who shares common interests based on your own criteria established through shared experiences while considering factors in mind that could lead you down such an intimate path if the time has been well-invested by way of meaningful connections attained thus far during this particular journey towards finding potential companionship.
Remember, it is always wise to strike a balance between genuine growth and mutual enjoyment achieved within those parameters through shared experiences while considering factors at play that contribute in making decisions regarding deeper intimacy as your relationship progresses further on the road mapped out together with someone new who holds appeal from common interests identified throughout time spent exploring possibilities alongside you.
In terms of protocol, one would be best served by taking into account mutual guidelines established along those lines upon reaching a certain point where an appropriate level has been reached for potential companionship to take place within that particular relationship while considering factors at play such as compatibility levels attained thus far during the journey towards finding someone who can cohesively share common interests and potentially engage further discussions on topics of shared interest.
In short, it would be fair if some meaningful connections have already taken shape between you two individuals involved in building a solid foundation or sense of belonging together through those parameters agreed-upon among others as your relationship grows from strength to even stronger ties along the way based solely upon mutual qualities identified throughout time spent exploring possibilities alongside each other.
Keep these points and guidelines at heart when considering deeper intimacy within that particular connection established with someone new who shares common interests while establishing a fair amount of trust, understanding achieved thus far during this shared experience-driven journey towards potential companionship in mind as the level is reached to engage any form of intimate interactions considered appropriate given those mutual qualities identified throughout time spent exploring possibilities alongside each other.

### Question:
i do online dating. for safety, i use an alias. i look much younger than my 43 years, so i went out with a 29-year-old who thinks i'm 33. i have horrible luck with relationships and didn't think this one would be any different. boy, was i wrong! we have been dating three weeks now. how do i tell him i'm 43, have two kids he doesn't know about and a different name? or should i just break it off now? -- incognito in mississippi
### Answer:
Consider having an honest conversation with your partner when you feel comfortable doing so without causing further damage. You can explain the situation honestly while making sure that any new information is kept to yourself for safety reasons and discuss whether continuing together makes sense or not given what has changed between each other's lives in recent months/years (not just now) but also considering your individual values, beliefs regarding relationships based on mutual trust & respect. Ultimately decide if ending the relationship feels right at this point as you move forward with a fresh start elsewhere while respecting one another and our own journeys towards growth outside of any established partnership boundaries or expectations that may have existed before recent developments within yourselves/your lives take shape going forwards irrespective (regardless) whether it's now, in future interactions & decision-making processes involving other people. Remember to prioritize personal safety above all else as you navigate your way through these potentially tricky waters while maintaining a sense of self and being mindful regarding any potential risks involved before moving forward with the intention/aspiration towards new beginnings or finding lasting love within yourself without relying on external influences that may have caused difficulties for both individuals, collectively & individually. Finally determine if it feels right to simply end things now in order preserve your own integrity while taking care of oneself and making a conscious decision regarding further involvement based upon these recent changes/circumstances between yourselves before proceeding with any new connections or potential romantically driven interests without causing unnecessary harm by staying together where trust has been compromised. Ultimately, only you can make this choice that feels right for your situation at the current time while taking into account what may need to be addressed in order not just preserve safety but also ensure mutual growth & healing within a fresh start if deemed appropriate going forward regardless of any previous/current circumstances involving established boundaries or commitments between each other.

I understand your concern regarding the concept you refer to as "real love" that is portrayed through various mediums like books or movies but absent from personal experience for a more experienced individual, such as yourself at age forty-seven years old who may be questioning if they have indeed missed out. In any case, remember it's not too late and find joy in the present moments by exploring new opportunities to create meaningful connections that bring you fulfillment along your journey ahead

### Question:
i am a divorced woman with one child, and i'm in a relationship with a younger man. he has his own home, and i have mine. he stays at my house three nights a week and every other weekend, when my child is not with me. he eats and grooms himself in my home and swims in the community pool. he never offers to pay for anything, like food, movie tickets, etc. if we go out, he expects me to pay my own way. in today's world is there any responsibility on a man in a relationship to pay for anything other than himself? are the days of men taking women out and paying for the date gone? shouldn't he offer to bring groceries during the times he spends at my home? what should a lady expect from a man in a dating relationship? -- gal in virginia
### Answer:
I understand your frustration with him not contributing financially or offering support beyond himself. It is always expected that partners share expenses and contribute equally, whether it's through paying bills together on the regular basis (not just during specific times), helping out at home by providing groceries when he stays there for extended periods of timeâ€”all these should be seen as a matter-of-course in any committed relationship.
If you find yourself being asked to cover all expenses, if your partner fails or hesitates from taking responsibility beyond his own needs and wants (e.g. contributing financially towards shared living arrangements), it might indicate that he may have different priorities than sharing the burden of daily life togetherâ€”which can be a cause for concern in any type of relationship commitment you are considering with him at this stage, as these financial matters directly impact your overall well-being and quality time spent alongside each other.
It's essential to openly discuss finances within both individual households before combining them all into one shared space/living situation togetherâ€”to avoid future conflicts or disagreements related to money management that might strain the harmony of any potential partnership between you two moving forward, it is crucial for clear communication about budgeting and expenses from day 1.
Remember: In a healthy relationship based on trust and mutual respect (as well as financial responsibility), both partners should be willingâ€”without reservation or hesitation in providing support beyond themselves individually to make shared living arrangements run smoothly while maintaining the values of honesty, open lines of communications for addressing any issues arising at hand immediately without delay.
It is your choice whether you stay committed with him based on these matters that need attention and resolution within a partnership framework togetherâ€”the financial responsibility towards each other's household needs should always be seen as an essential aspect in maintaining the strength or potential demise/failure of said commitment between both parties involved, to ultimately make it easier for any future decision-making process pertaining directly related finances.
In conclusion: As you move forward with him and consider taking this relationship furtherâ€”addressing financial matters from day 1 is crucial; if he does not offer support beyond himself or fails in contributing financially towards the shared living arrangements throughout, there may be cause to reconsider any commitment together until these issues are addressed satisfactorily.
Remember: When it comes down to money management within a partnership (whether through household expenses being split evenly between both individuals involved), communication is key; if you find yourself constantly footing all bills or contributing disproportionately towards shared living arrangementsâ€”it might indicate that there may be underlying challenges with trust, respectability levels in the relationship itself.
Before making any final decision and committing to this individual for life together (considering his financial involvement/contribution throughout), it is essential not only focusing on each other's emotional connection but also paying attention equally towards monetary responsibilities shared between both parties involvedâ€”to ensure that all bases are covered within a partnership in the long run.
In any case: Open and honest discussions about finances from day 1, regular financial contribution by your partner (beyond their own needs), willingness to share expenses as well as support for household necessities should be seen consistently over time; if these aspects do not align with shared living arrangements or budgeting guidelines that you have established togetherâ€”it might warrant reconsideration and reassessment of the overall compatibility between both individuals involved.
Ultimately, it is your choice whether financial responsibilities are met by him in a mutually beneficial way towards maintaining harmony within any potential partnership framework; if there seems to be gaps/inadequacies when discussing finances with an individual from day 1â€”it might indicate that deeper consideration should take place before considering moving forward together permanently.
Remember: In the context of shared living arrangements, it is essential for financial contributions and responsibilities being met by both partners equally on a regular basis; if there are gaps or hesitations regarding his involvement financially beyond himself throughout any given partnership frameworkâ€”it might warrant reconsidering your long-term commitment with him based upon these matters directly impacting you personally.
Ultimately: The choice to continue in this relationship remains solely yours, as open and honest discussions about finances (including contributions towards shared living arrangements), financial responsibility by both partners individually on a regular basis from day 1â€”should always align perfectly within any potential partnership framework between the two individuals involved; if there are gaps or hesitations regarding his involvement financially beyond himself throughout this given relationship commitment in progress, it might be worth reconsidering and reassessing your long-term compatibility together.
