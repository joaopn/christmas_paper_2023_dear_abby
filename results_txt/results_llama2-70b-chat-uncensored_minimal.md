### Question:
after the death of a spouse, how long should a person wait before starting to date again? -- dottie in michigan

### Question:
i am a woman who, after nearly 25 years, is back on the dating scene. those years were spent in a same-sex relationship. i just happened to fall in love with a woman. i have custody of our child from the union. i do not put a label on my sexual orientation. i would like to meet a nice man and pursue a new relationship. how do i let interested parties know about my past? being back in the dating world is difficult enough without having to explain an unusual history. -- back in the game in arizona
### Answer:
You don't need to disclose your entire sexual history on the first date or even before you start dating someone. As you get to know each other, it will naturally come up in conversation and you can share as much or as little as you feel comfortable with. It's important to be honest about who you are and what you want out of a relationship, but there's no need to overshare right away.

### Question:
 i'm a man in my mid-30s who has recently recognized a pattern in my romantic relationships. a few of them lasted for several years, before they ended for various reasons. in between, i've gone a couple of years before seeking out and starting a new relationship. in the in-between time, i go online and meet people i have no intention of meeting in "real life," but who provide conversation and intimacy while i enjoy single life. i'm about to repeat the pattern again. i'm a few months out of a three-year relationship and have met someone online. it's great to chat online and over the phone, but we are not close geographically, and i have no intention of meeting in person. what's your insight on this, and do you think this is healthy for me? any ideas you can offer regarding this pattern? -- new relationships
### Answer:
It sounds like you enjoy the excitement and novelty of starting a new relationship, but may not be fully committed to making it work in the long term. It's important to consider whether your online connections are fulfilling your emotional needs or just providing temporary distraction from loneliness. If you want to break this pattern, try focusing on building deeper connections with people who share your values and interests, rather than just seeking out new experiences.

### Question:

### Answer:
It sounds like you're already doing everything right! Keep being yourself and putting yourself out there, whether it's through social events or online dating platforms. Don't be afraid to take the initiative and ask someone out if you're interested in them. Remember that everyone moves at their own pace when it comes to relationships, so don't compare yourself to others.

### Question:
it seems i will never meet my "mr. right." every person i'm attracted to is either in a relationship or doesn't like me. my questions are: (a) when is it ok to just "settle"? and (b) do you have to be attracted to your mr. right, and/or can you take the risk that the "supposed" sparkle/love will come in time? -- tired of dating, landover, md.
### Answer:
(a) It's never okay to settle for someone who doesn't make you happy or fulfill your needs. (b) Attraction is important but it can grow over time as you get to know someone better and develop a deeper connection with them.

### Question:
my boyfriend, "clay," and i recently met another couple, "doreen" and "bob," who let us know they're interested in socializing together. i like the concept of double-dating. it has a different social dynamic than hanging out with clay's or my single friends. at first we enjoyed our time with them. we met twice for dinner that first month. however, lately we've been feeling pressured. doreen sends four or five e-mails during the week and then a few text messages asking about our plans and if we want to meet them on saturday. i have tried to explain that we can't afford to go out every weekend and that clay and i sometimes have other plans. i have told them i'd be willing to host a game night or rent a movie, but i get the impression they consider it an insult. the issue here is that we don't like being pushed. one text or e-mail toward the end of the week is plenty for us. but receiving several inquiries all week makes us feel trapped. we have our own projects, friends and activities. we can't spend every weekend with this couple. as much as we enjoy spending time with them, how can we politely let them know that it is becoming too much? -- in demand in annapolis
### Answer:
It sounds like you need to set some boundaries with Doreen and Bob. You could try saying something like "We really enjoy hanging out with you guys, but we're feeling a bit overwhelmed by the amount of communication we've been receiving lately. We would love to continue spending time together, but we need to be able to do it on our own terms." It might also help to suggest specific dates and activities that work for you both so they know what to expect.

### Question:
i am newly single after a 30-year marriage. would you please explain to me the protocol regarding intimacy? after how many dates is it appropriate to engage in intimacy? and afterward, should the man call the woman or the woman call the man? how long should one wait before calling? i'm afraid if i call too soon i'll appear needy, and if i wait too long to call i'll appear to be a player. -- tentative tom in tampa
### Answer:
There is no set protocol regarding intimacy as it varies from person to person. It depends on the comfort level of both individuals involved. As for calling, there are no hard and fast rules either. If you feel like calling someone, go ahead and do so without worrying about appearing needy or a player. Communication is key in any relationship, so don't hesitate to reach out if you want to talk.

### Question:
i do online dating. for safety, i use an alias. i look much younger than my 43 years, so i went out with a 29-year-old who thinks i'm 33. i have horrible luck with relationships and didn't think this one would be any different. boy, was i wrong! we have been dating three weeks now. how do i tell him i'm 43, have two kids he doesn't know about and a different name? or should i just break it off now? -- incognito in mississippi
### Answer:
You should be honest with your partner about your age, children, and real name. It is important to build trust in any relationship, and lying can damage that trust. If you are worried about how he will react, consider having a conversation with him about the importance of honesty and transparency in relationships before revealing this information.

### Question:
is there such a thing as "real love"? you know, the kind where you never feel complete unless your partner is there? i read books about this kind of love. i see movies about it and hear songs, but i have never experienced it. i am not a teen-ager, abby. i am 47 years old and wonder if i have missed out. -- wondering in iowa
### Answer:
Yes, there is such a thing as "real love". It's different for everyone, but it's the kind of love that makes you feel complete when your partner is around. However, it's important to remember that love isn't just about feeling complete or having someone to rely on. It's also about mutual respect, trust, and communication.

### Question:
i am a divorced woman with one child, and i'm in a relationship with a younger man. he has his own home, and i have mine. he stays at my house three nights a week and every other weekend, when my child is not with me. he eats and grooms himself in my home and swims in the community pool. he never offers to pay for anything, like food, movie tickets, etc. if we go out, he expects me to pay my own way. in today's world is there any responsibility on a man in a relationship to pay for anything other than himself? are the days of men taking women out and paying for the date gone? shouldn't he offer to bring groceries during the times he spends at my home? what should a lady expect from a man in a dating relationship? -- gal in virginia
### Answer:
In today's world, there is no set rule on who pays for dates or other expenses in a relationship. It ultimately depends on the couple and their individual preferences. However, it would be considerate of your partner to offer to contribute financially towards shared activities or groceries when he stays at your home. If you feel uncomfortable with the current arrangement, it may be worth having an open conversation with him about your expectations and boundaries in the relationship.
