### Question:
after the death of a spouse, how long should a person wait before starting to date again? -- dottie in michigan
### Answer:
It's important to take your time and not rush into dating after the death of a partner. It's natural to feel a sense of loss and grief, but it's also important to move forward and focus on moving forward. It can be helpful to have some time to process and come to terms with the loss before starting to date again.

It's important to remember that death is a part of life and that there are no right or wrong ways to grieve. It's okay to feel sad, and it's healthy to move forward with your life. It's also important to take care of yourself, which can include seeking support from friends and family, getting enough sleep, and practicing self-care activities

### Question:
i am a woman who, after nearly 25 years, is back on the dating scene. those years were spent in a same-sex relationship. i just happened to fall in love with a woman. i have custody of our child from the union. i do not put a label on my sexual orientation. i would like to meet a nice man and pursue a new relationship. how do i let interested parties know about my past? being back in the dating world is difficult enough without having to explain an unusual history. -- back in the game in arizona
### Answer:
I would suggest that you focus on your personal journey and share it with others, but also be mindful of the fact that people do not always understand or respect your choices. It is important to remember that everyone has their own unique story and that there are many different perspectives out there. If you feel like you need to explain everything to everyone, then I would suggest that you prioritize keeping it private

### Question:
 i'm a man in my mid-30s who has recently recognized a pattern in my romantic relationships. a few of them lasted for several years, before they ended for various reasons. in between, i've gone a couple of years before seeking out and starting a new relationship. in the in-between time, i go online and meet people i have no intention of meeting in "real life," but who provide conversation and intimacy while i enjoy single life. i'm about to repeat the pattern again. i'm a few months out of a three-year relationship and have met someone online. it's great to chat online and over the phone, but we are not close geographically, and i have no intention of meeting in person. what's your insight on this, and do you think this is healthy for me? any ideas you can offer regarding this pattern? -- new relationships
### Answer:
It sounds like you are experiencing a common pattern that can be healthy and positive. Online dating or meeting people in person for the first time can be intimidating, but it's important to remember that love conquers all. It's okay to say no if you don't feel a connection with someone, and it's also important to be open to new experiences and relationships.

If this is a pattern that you are going through, I would recommend taking some time to reflect on why you are experiencing this way of dating. Is it because you are looking for a relationship that will last or because you are not interested in being committed? It's important to take the time to understand your needs and desires before moving forward with any new relationships.

Ultimately, love conquers all, so enjoy the journey and don't be afraid to try something new!

### Question:
it seems i will never meet my "mr. right." every person i'm attracted to is either in a relationship or doesn't like me. my questions are: (a) when is it ok to just "settle"? and (b) do you have to be attracted to your mr. right, and/or can you take the risk that the "supposed" sparkle/love will come in time? -- tired of dating, landover, md.
### Answer:
(a) It's important to remember that love is a journey and not a destination. It's important to be open-minded and flexible in your relationships, as it can take time for something serious to develop. If you're not seeing any progress with your current partner, it may be helpful to take a step back and evaluate your priorities.

(b) While it's true that attractive people are often the first to notice and fall in love with someone, it's also important to remember that love is a journey of exploration and mutual respect. If you're not feeling a sense of connection with your current partner, it may be helpful to take some time to reflect on why you're not experiencing it.

(c) It's important to remember that everyone has their own unique set of experiences and perspectives that contribute to their sense of love and happiness. If you're feeling stuck or unfulfilled in your current relationship, it may be helpful to take some time to reflect on what you value in a partner and what you're looking for in a relationship.

(d) It's also important to remember that not everyone will be the right fit for you. If you're not feeling a sense of connection with someone, it may be helpful to take some time to evaluate your values and priorities, as well as your partner's needs and expectations.

Overall, it's important to be open-minded and flexible in your relationships, and to take the time to reflect on what you value and what you're looking for in a partner

### Question:
my boyfriend, "clay," and i recently met another couple, "doreen" and "bob," who let us know they're interested in socializing together. i like the concept of double-dating. it has a different social dynamic than hanging out with clay's or my single friends. at first we enjoyed our time with them. we met twice for dinner that first month. however, lately we've been feeling pressured. doreen sends four or five e-mails during the week and then a few text messages asking about our plans and if we want to meet them on saturday. i have tried to explain that we can't afford to go out every weekend and that clay and i sometimes have other plans. i have told them i'd be willing to host a game night or rent a movie, but i get the impression they consider it an insult. the issue here is that we don't like being pushed. one text or e-mail toward the end of the week is plenty for us. but receiving several inquiries all week makes us feel trapped. we have our own projects, friends and activities. we can't spend every weekend with this couple. as much as we enjoy spending time with them, how can we politely let them know that it is becoming too much? -- in demand in annapolis
### Answer:
It sounds like you and your boyfriend have a good relationship, but you both want to maintain some control over the social calendar. You may want to consider setting up a date night or two a week with friends or other couples who are not involved in a relationship with clay and doreen. This way, you can still enjoy socializing with your boyfriend while also ensuring that you have time for your own interests and relationships.

It's important to remember that everyone has their own priorities and needs, so it's important to be respectful of each other's choices and boundaries

### Question:
i am newly single after a 30-year marriage. would you please explain to me the protocol regarding intimacy? after how many dates is it appropriate to engage in intimacy? and afterward, should the man call the woman or the woman call the man? how long should one wait before calling? i'm afraid if i call too soon i'll appear needy, and if i wait too long to call i'll appear to be a player. -- tentative tom in tampa
### Answer:
I would advise you to be patient and not take any action until you have had enough time to evaluate the situation and determine if there is still a chance for a relationship. It's important to remember that every person is unique and has their own set of experiences, strengths, and weaknesses, so what works for one person may not work for another.

Regarding intimacy, it's important to respect each other's boundaries and understand that everyone has different needs and desires. It's also important to be open and honest with each other about your feelings and expectations, and to take care of yourself in order to provide the best possible experience for both of you.

After a certain number of dates, it's appropriate to start considering intimacy again. However, it's important to remember that every person is unique and has their own set of experiences, strengths, and weaknesses. It's also important to respect each other's boundaries and understand that everyone has different needs and desires.

It's important to take care of yourself in order to provide the best possible experience for both of you. This means taking time for yourself, eating well, exercising, getting enough sleep, and being active. It's also important to prioritize your own needs and make sure that you are taking care of yourself before you can focus on the needs of another person

Real love is a complex and multifaceted emotion that can be difficult to define. While there is no one "true" definition of real love, there are many elements that can contribute to the feeling of completeness that comes from genuine and mutual affection. Here are some common characteristics of real love:

1. Commitment: Real love involves a deep emotional connection and a willingness to invest in the other person's happiness. It is not just about physical attraction or sexual desire, but rather about creating a sense of belonging and fulfillment that comes from a mutual commitment to each other.

2. Support: Real love requires a strong support system that can provide emotional and material resources when needed. This could include friends, family, or a significant other who is there to hold you accountable and support you in your relationships.

3. Emotional intimacy: Real love often involves a deep connection between the partners where both parties feel safe, secure, and supported. This can involve physical closeness, but it can also include other elements such as shared interests, hobbies, or even just being able to share each other's thoughts and feelings.

4. Commitment: Real love requires a willingness to put in the effort and be there for your partner, whether that means spending time together, going out of your way to make their day, or simply listening to their concerns.

5. Authenticity: Real love is not just about physical attraction or sexual desire. It can also involve a deep connection to one's values and beliefs, which may include personal growth, self-expression, or a shared sense of purpose.

It's important to note that the definition of real love may vary depending on the individual and their experiences. However, by focusing on the elements that contribute to the feeling of completeness that comes from genuine and mutual affection, it is possible to cultivate a strong and meaningful relationship based on a deep connection with one's partner
