### Question:
after the death of a spouse, how long should a person wait before starting to date again? -- dottie in michigan
### Answer:
Dear Dottie,

The grieving process is deeply personal, and there's no one-size-fits-all timeline for when it's appropriate to start dating again after the loss of a spouse. Some people may feel ready after a few months, while others may take years. The key is to wait until you feel emotionally prepared to form a new romantic connection without feeling like you're betraying your late spouse's memory.

Listen to your heart, and don't let others dictate your timeline. When you find yourself longing for companionship and are able to think about dating without overwhelming guilt or sadness, it might be a sign that you're ready to take that step. Remember, seeking happiness does not diminish the love you had for your spouse.

Warm regards,
Abby

### Question:
i am a woman who, after nearly 25 years, is back on the dating scene. those years were spent in a same-sex relationship. i just happened to fall in love with a woman. i have custody of our child from the union. i do not put a label on my sexual orientation. i would like to meet a nice man and pursue a new relationship. how do i let interested parties know about my past? being back in the dating world is difficult enough without having to explain an unusual history. -- back in the game in arizona
### Answer:
Dear Back in the Game in Arizona,

Welcome back to the dating scene! It's perfectly natural to feel a bit out of practice after such a long time, but remember, everyone has a history, and yours is nothing to be ashamed of. When it comes to sharing your past, honesty is the best policy, but it doesn't require full disclosure on the first date. Take the time to get to know someone, and as trust builds, you can share more about your previous relationship. If a man is truly interested in you, he will appreciate your openness and the love you have for your child. Your past has shaped who you are, and the right person will embrace every chapter of your story. Remember, you're not explaining an "unusual history"—you're sharing a part of your life. Good luck, and may you find someone who cherishes you for the unique and wonderful person you are.

With warmth and encouragement,
Abby

### Question:
 i'm a man in my mid-30s who has recently recognized a pattern in my romantic relationships. a few of them lasted for several years, before they ended for various reasons. in between, i've gone a couple of years before seeking out and starting a new relationship. in the in-between time, i go online and meet people i have no intention of meeting in "real life," but who provide conversation and intimacy while i enjoy single life. i'm about to repeat the pattern again. i'm a few months out of a three-year relationship and have met someone online. it's great to chat online and over the phone, but we are not close geographically, and i have no intention of meeting in person. what's your insight on this, and do you think this is healthy for me? any ideas you can offer regarding this pattern? -- new relationships
### Answer:
Dear New Relationships,

Recognizing patterns in your behavior is the first step toward understanding your needs and desires. It's not uncommon to seek out companionship, even if it's virtual, during periods of singlehood. However, it's important to consider the feelings of those you interact with online. If both parties are aware and consenting to the nature of the relationship, with clear boundaries and no false expectations, then this can be a part of a healthy single life.

That said, if you find this pattern is a way to avoid deeper issues or fears about commitment and intimacy, it might be worth exploring these feelings, perhaps with a professional. It's also crucial to ensure that these online interactions aren't a substitute for genuine connection and growth that can be achieved through in-person relationships.

Reflect on what you truly want in the long term. If you desire a lasting, physical partnership, consider taking steps towards that goal. If you're content with your current approach, just be honest with yourself and your online companions. Balance is key, and as long as you're not harming yourself or others, you have the freedom to choose how you connect with people.

Kind regards,
Abby

### Question:
i'm 20 years old and have never dated anyone. i have a lot of friends and do well in school and at work, and i try to be a good, kind, friendly person. what can i do to make myself datable? am i missing some crucial step in how to become a girlfriend? -- old maid in st. louis
### Answer:
Dear Old Maid in St. Louis,

Firstly, let's toss out that "old maid" moniker—you're just 20 and at the beginning of life's grand journey! It's perfectly normal to have not dated at your age, so don't let that label weigh you down.

Being datable isn't about checking off a list of criteria; it's about being your authentic self and being open to the possibility of a relationship. You're already on the right track by being a good, kind, and friendly person. That's the foundation of being someone worth dating.

Here are a few tips to help you along the way:

1. **Expand Your Social Circle**: Continue to make new friends and explore different social settings. The more people you meet, the higher the chance of finding someone you click with romantically.

2. **Pursue Your Interests**: Engage in activities you love. It's a great way to meet like-minded individuals and you'll be at your most passionate and interesting when doing what you enjoy.

3. **Be Open**: Sometimes, letting friends know you're interested in dating can open up opportunities. They might know someone who could be a great match for you.

4. **Online Dating**: Consider giving online dating a try. It can be a practical way to meet people, especially if you're clear about your intentions and what you're looking for.

5. **Self-Confidence**: Continue to build your self-esteem. Confidence is attractive, and being comfortable in your own skin can make a world of difference.

6. **Be Patient**: Good things often take time. Don't rush into a relationship just for the sake of being in one. Wait for someone who appreciates you for who you are.

Remember, there's no set timeline for these things. Focus on living a fulfilling life, and a relationship will come when the time is right.

With kindness and confidence,
Abby

### Question:
it seems i will never meet my "mr. right." every person i'm attracted to is either in a relationship or doesn't like me. my questions are: (a) when is it ok to just "settle"? and (b) do you have to be attracted to your mr. right, and/or can you take the risk that the "supposed" sparkle/love will come in time? -- tired of dating, landover, md.
### Answer:
Dear Tired of Dating,

(a) Settling is a term that often carries a negative connotation, implying that you're giving up on your dreams or desires. However, it's important to differentiate between unrealistic expectations and settling for less than you deserve. It's okay to reassess what is truly important to you in a partner and to be open to different types of people. But it's never okay to settle in a way that compromises your core values or leaves you feeling unfulfilled or unhappy.

(b) Attraction can be an important component of a romantic relationship, but it's not the only one. Respect, compatibility, shared values, and friendship are equally significant. Sometimes, the sparkle or love can indeed grow over time as you get to know someone on a deeper level. However, there should be at least a spark of interest or admiration from the start. Don't force a romantic connection if it's not there at all; a relationship without any attraction can be just as unfulfilling as one based solely on physical appeal.

Remember, your Mr. Right should make you feel good about yourself, share your fundamental values, and be someone you can see yourself growing with. Don't rush the process; it's better to be single and open to the right person than to be in a relationship that doesn't bring you joy.

Warm regards,
Abby

### Question:
my boyfriend, "clay," and i recently met another couple, "doreen" and "bob," who let us know they're interested in socializing together. i like the concept of double-dating. it has a different social dynamic than hanging out with clay's or my single friends. at first we enjoyed our time with them. we met twice for dinner that first month. however, lately we've been feeling pressured. doreen sends four or five e-mails during the week and then a few text messages asking about our plans and if we want to meet them on saturday. i have tried to explain that we can't afford to go out every weekend and that clay and i sometimes have other plans. i have told them i'd be willing to host a game night or rent a movie, but i get the impression they consider it an insult. the issue here is that we don't like being pushed. one text or e-mail toward the end of the week is plenty for us. but receiving several inquiries all week makes us feel trapped. we have our own projects, friends and activities. we can't spend every weekend with this couple. as much as we enjoy spending time with them, how can we politely let them know that it is becoming too much? -- in demand in annapolis
### Answer:
Dear In Demand in Annapolis,

It's wonderful that you've found a couple you enjoy spending time with, but it's equally important to maintain your personal space and boundaries. It's time for a gentle but firm conversation. Let Doreen and Bob know that while you value their friendship, you and Clay have various commitments and can't always be available. Suggest planning one evening a month in advance, so it's something to look forward to without the pressure. Assure them that your need for space is not a reflection of your feelings towards them, but a balance you seek in all areas of your life. If they are true friends, they will understand and respect your wishes. Remember, true friendship is not about quantity, but quality.

Kind regards,
Abby

### Question:
i am newly single after a 30-year marriage. would you please explain to me the protocol regarding intimacy? after how many dates is it appropriate to engage in intimacy? and afterward, should the man call the woman or the woman call the man? how long should one wait before calling? i'm afraid if i call too soon i'll appear needy, and if i wait too long to call i'll appear to be a player. -- tentative tom in tampa
### Answer:
Dear Tentative Tom in Tampa,

Navigating the dating scene after a long hiatus can indeed feel like learning a foreign language. But fear not, the principles of respect and communication are timeless.

When it comes to intimacy, there's no one-size-fits-all rule for "how many dates." It's about when you feel a mutual connection and trust, and when you've had open and honest communication about expectations. Always ensure that consent is clear and enthusiastic.

As for the calling conundrum, the old "three-day rule" is outdated. If you had a good time and want to see the person again, it's perfectly acceptable to reach out the next day to express your interest and possibly set up another date. Waiting too long can indeed send the wrong signal, just as rushing might. Trust your instincts and aim for a balance that feels respectful and considerate.

Remember, being genuine is key. If you're acting with integrity and respect, you won't come off as needy or as a player. You'll simply be Tom, a man stepping into the dating world with both vulnerability and confidence. Good luck!

Warmly,
Abby

### Question:
i do online dating. for safety, i use an alias. i look much younger than my 43 years, so i went out with a 29-year-old who thinks i'm 33. i have horrible luck with relationships and didn't think this one would be any different. boy, was i wrong! we have been dating three weeks now. how do i tell him i'm 43, have two kids he doesn't know about and a different name? or should i just break it off now? -- incognito in mississippi
### Answer:
Dear Incognito in Mississippi,

Honesty is the cornerstone of any meaningful relationship. It's time to come clean with your beau. Sit down with him in a private, comfortable setting and explain your reasons for not being forthcoming initially. Acknowledge that you understand if this changes his feelings but express your genuine interest in continuing the relationship with all cards on the table. It's better to face the music now than to build a relationship on a foundation of falsehoods. If he values you and the connection you've built, he may be willing to understand and move forward. If not, it's a lesson learned in the importance of honesty from the start.

Warm regards,
Abby

### Question:
how do you attract single women while on a budget? -- gary in longwood, fla.
### Answer:
Dear Gary in Longwood,

Attracting single women doesn't require a hefty wallet, but it does call for creativity, sincerity, and effort. Focus on showcasing your personality and interests. Here are a few budget-friendly tips:

1. **Explore Free Events**: Attend community events, art galleries, or local festivals where you can meet people with similar interests.

2. **Nature's Bounty**: Plan outings in nature, like walks in the park or a day at the beach. These settings are perfect for conversations and cost nothing.

3. **Volunteer**: Offer your time to a cause you care about. It's a great way to meet compassionate individuals while doing good.

4. **DIY Dates**: Cook a meal together or have a picnic with homemade treats. It's personal and shows thoughtfulness.

5. **Learn Together**: Find free workshops or lectures, and invite someone to join you. It's a unique way to bond over new experiences.

Remember, Gary, the most attractive quality isn't the thickness of your wallet, but the depth of your character. Show genuine interest, be yourself, and let connections build naturally.

Wishing you the best of luck,
Abby

### Question:
how do you respond if you're dating a much older man and someone asks if he is your father? -- the younger woman in vero beach, fla.
### Answer:
Dear Younger Woman in Vero Beach,

When someone mistakes your partner for your father, respond with poise and a touch of humor. A simple, "Oh, he's not my dad, he's the wonderful man in my life," should suffice. It acknowledges the mistake without making anyone feel uncomfortable. Remember, your happiness with your partner is what truly matters, not the assumptions of others.

Warmly,
Abby

### Question:
is there such a thing as "real love"? you know, the kind where you never feel complete unless your partner is there? i read books about this kind of love. i see movies about it and hear songs, but i have never experienced it. i am not a teen-ager, abby. i am 47 years old and wonder if i have missed out. -- wondering in iowa
### Answer:
Dear Wondering in Iowa,

Real love does exist, but it's not always as dramatic as the books, movies, and songs make it out to be. It's not about feeling incomplete without someone; it's about two whole individuals coming together to share their lives in a meaningful way. It's about mutual respect, support, and understanding. You haven't missed out—love doesn't have an expiration date. It can come at any time, often when you least expect it. Keep your heart open, live a life you love, and you may find that love will find its way to you in its own time and in its own way.

With affection,
Abby

### Question:
i am a divorced woman with one child, and i'm in a relationship with a younger man. he has his own home, and i have mine. he stays at my house three nights a week and every other weekend, when my child is not with me. he eats and grooms himself in my home and swims in the community pool. he never offers to pay for anything, like food, movie tickets, etc. if we go out, he expects me to pay my own way. in today's world is there any responsibility on a man in a relationship to pay for anything other than himself? are the days of men taking women out and paying for the date gone? shouldn't he offer to bring groceries during the times he spends at my home? what should a lady expect from a man in a dating relationship? -- gal in virginia
### Answer:
Dear Gal in Virginia,

In any relationship, regardless of gender roles or age differences, the key ingredients are communication and mutual respect. It's not about who pays for what, but rather about the balance of give and take that makes both partners feel valued and respected.

If you feel that the financial responsibilities in your relationship are unbalanced, it's important to address this with your partner. A candid conversation about expectations and contributions is necessary. It's perfectly reasonable to expect a partner to chip in, especially if they're partaking in the benefits of your home, like food and amenities.

Remember, a gentleman—or any partner, for that matter—should want to contribute to the relationship in a way that feels fair to both of you. It's not about adhering to outdated norms, but about crafting a partnership that works for both parties involved. If he values the relationship, he should be open to discussing and adjusting the financial dynamics.

Warm regards,
Abby
