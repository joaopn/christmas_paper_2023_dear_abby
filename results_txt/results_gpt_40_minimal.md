i am a woman who, after nearly 25 years, is back on the dating scene. those years were spent in a same-sex relationship. i just happened to fall in love with a woman. i have custody of our child from the union. i do not put a label on my sexual orientation. i would like to meet a nice man and pursue a new relationship. how do i let interested parties know about my past? being back in the dating world is difficult enough without having to explain an unusual history. -- back in the game in arizona
### Answer:
Honesty is key in any relationship. When you feel comfortable and trust has been established, share your past. It's part of who you are. Anyone worth your time will understand and accept you for who you are, past and all. Remember, your past relationship doesn't define you, it's just a part of your story.

### Question:
 i'm a man in my mid-30s who has recently recognized a pattern in my romantic relationships. a few of them lasted for several years, before they ended for various reasons. in between, i've gone a couple of years before seeking out and starting a new relationship. in the in-between time, i go online and meet people i have no intention of meeting in "real life," but who provide conversation and intimacy while i enjoy single life. i'm about to repeat the pattern again. i'm a few months out of a three-year relationship and have met someone online. it's great to chat online and over the phone, but we are not close geographically, and i have no intention of meeting in person. what's your insight on this, and do you think this is healthy for me? any ideas you can offer regarding this pattern? -- new relationships
### Answer:
It sounds like you've found a pattern that works for you, providing both periods of deep connection and periods of independence. However, it's important to ensure that the people you're interacting with online are aware of your intentions. If they're under the impression that the relationship could become more serious or physical, it's only fair to communicate your intentions clearly. As long as you're honest and respectful, there's no right or wrong way to manage your relationships. It's all about what makes you happy and fulfilled.

### Answer:
You're not missing any crucial step. Everyone's journey in love is unique. Focus on being the best version of yourself, pursue your interests, and the right person will come along. Remember, it's not about making yourself datable, it's about finding someone who appreciates you for who you are.

### Question:
it seems i will never meet my "mr. right." every person i'm attracted to is either in a relationship or doesn't like me. my questions are: (a) when is it ok to just "settle"? and (b) do you have to be attracted to your mr. right, and/or can you take the risk that the "supposed" sparkle/love will come in time? -- tired of dating, landover, md.
### Answer:
(a) Never settle for less than what you deserve. It's better to be single than in a wrong relationship. (b) Physical attraction can be a part of love, but it's not everything. Emotional connection and compatibility are more important. Love can grow over time, but don't force it. Be patient and focus on being the best version of yourself. The right person will come along.

### Question:
my boyfriend, "clay," and i recently met another couple, "doreen" and "bob," who let us know they're interested in socializing together. i like the concept of double-dating. it has a different social dynamic than hanging out with clay's or my single friends. at first we enjoyed our time with them. we met twice for dinner that first month. however, lately we've been feeling pressured. doreen sends four or five e-mails during the week and then a few text messages asking about our plans and if we want to meet them on saturday. i have tried to explain that we can't afford to go out every weekend and that clay and i sometimes have other plans. i have told them i'd be willing to host a game night or rent a movie, but i get the impression they consider it an insult. the issue here is that we don't like being pushed. one text or e-mail toward the end of the week is plenty for us. but receiving several inquiries all week makes us feel trapped. we have our own projects, friends and activities. we can't spend every weekend with this couple. as much as we enjoy spending time with them, how can we politely let them know that it is becoming too much? -- in demand in annapolis
### Answer:
It's important to set boundaries in any relationship, including friendships. Be honest and direct with Doreen and Bob. Let them know that while you enjoy their company, you also have other commitments and can't meet every weekend. Suggest setting a regular schedule, like once a month, for your double dates. This way, they'll know when to expect to see you and it will reduce the pressure on you.

### Question:
i am newly single after a 30-year marriage. would you please explain to me the protocol regarding intimacy? after how many dates is it appropriate to engage in intimacy? and afterward, should the man call the woman or the woman call the man? how long should one wait before calling? i'm afraid if i call too soon i'll appear needy, and if i wait too long to call i'll appear to be a player. -- tentative tom in tampa
### Answer:
Dear Tentative Tom,

There's no set rule for when to engage in intimacy; it's about when both parties feel comfortable and ready. Communication is key. As for calling, it's not about gender but about showing interest and respect. If you enjoyed the date, it's perfectly fine to call or text the next day. It's not needy, it's considerate. Waiting too long might send the wrong message. Remember, honesty and respect never go out of style.

### Question:
i do online dating. for safety, i use an alias. i look much younger than my 43 years, so i went out with a 29-year-old who thinks i'm 33. i have horrible luck with relationships and didn't think this one would be any different. boy, was i wrong! we have been dating three weeks now. how do i tell him i'm 43, have two kids he doesn't know about and a different name? or should i just break it off now? -- incognito in mississippi
### Answer:
Honesty is the foundation of any successful relationship. It's important to come clean about your age, your kids, and your real name. If he truly cares about you, he will understand why you initially hid these details. However, be prepared for any reaction. If he feels betrayed or lied to, it's his right to feel that way. In the future, try to be more upfront to avoid such situations.

### Question:

### Answer:
Gary, attracting women isn't about how much money you have, but about showing genuine interest, respect, and kindness. Be confident, authentic, and attentive. Plan thoughtful, budget-friendly dates like picnics, hikes, or free local events. Remember, it's the quality of time spent together, not the amount of money spent, that truly matters.

### Question:
how do you respond if you're dating a much older man and someone asks if he is your father? -- the younger woman in vero beach, fla.

Respond with confidence and humor. Say something like, "No, he's not my father, he's my partner. We're just fortunate enough to enjoy a timeless love." Remember, it's your relationship and you don't owe anyone an explanation.

### Question:
is there such a thing as "real love"? you know, the kind where you never feel complete unless your partner is there? i read books about this kind of love. i see movies about it and hear songs, but i have never experienced it. i am not a teen-ager, abby. i am 47 years old and wonder if i have missed out. -- wondering in iowa
### Answer:
Dear Wondering in Iowa,

Yes, there is such a thing as "real love," but it's important to remember that it's not always like what we see in movies or read in books. Real love is about mutual respect, understanding, and shared values. It's not about feeling incomplete without your partner, but rather feeling enhanced when they're around. It's never too late to experience this kind of love. Keep an open heart and mind.

### Question:
i am a divorced woman with one child, and i'm in a relationship with a younger man. he has his own home, and i have mine. he stays at my house three nights a week and every other weekend, when my child is not with me. he eats and grooms himself in my home and swims in the community pool. he never offers to pay for anything, like food, movie tickets, etc. if we go out, he expects me to pay my own way. in today's world is there any responsibility on a man in a relationship to pay for anything other than himself? are the days of men taking women out and paying for the date gone? shouldn't he offer to bring groceries during the times he spends at my home? what should a lady expect from a man in a dating relationship? -- gal in virginia
### Answer:
In a modern relationship, financial responsibilities should ideally be shared based on each person's ability and comfort level. It's not about gender roles, but about mutual respect and understanding. If you feel he's taking advantage of your hospitality, it's important to communicate your feelings. It's perfectly reasonable to expect him to contribute, especially if he's regularly eating and spending time at your home. Remember, a healthy relationship involves open communication and mutual respect.
