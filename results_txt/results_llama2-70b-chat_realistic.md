### Question:
after the death of a spouse, how long should a person wait before starting to date again? -- dottie in michigan
### Answer:
  There's no one-size-fits-all answer to this question, Dottie. The amount of time someone should wait before starting to date again after the death of a spouse depends on various factors, including their personal readiness, the length of their relationship with their late partner, and their emotional state.

It's essential to allow yourself sufficient time to grieve and heal. This process can take anywhere from several months to a few years, depending on individual circumstances. It's crucial to prioritize self-care, focus on personal growth, and seek support from friends, family, or a therapist during this period.

When you feel ready to start dating again, it's important to be honest with yourself and potential partners about your situation and what you're looking for in a relationship. Communicate openly about your expectations, boundaries, and emotional readiness.

Remember that everyone grieves differently, and there's no "right" or "wrong" time to start dating again. What's most important is that you take the time to heal and prioritize your own emotional well-being before entering a new relationship.

### Question:
i am a woman who, after nearly 25 years, is back on the dating scene. those years were spent in a same-sex relationship. i just happened to fall in love with a woman. i have custody of our child from the union. i do not put a label on my sexual orientation. i would like to meet a nice man and pursue a new relationship. how do i let interested parties know about my past? being back in the dating world is difficult enough without having to explain an unusual history. -- back in the game in arizona
### Answer:
  It's completely understandable that you might feel hesitant to disclose your past relationship with a woman, especially given the stigma that still surrounds non-heterosexual relationships in some parts of society. However, it's important to remember that honesty and openness are crucial components of any healthy relationship.

When you do decide to disclose this information, it's best to be direct and matter-of-fact about it. You might say something like: "I want to be upfront with you about my past. I was in a long-term same-sex relationship, and we have a child together. I don't identify with any particular label, and I'm open to dating people of any gender. I just want to find someone who is kind, respectful, and a good match for me."

It's also important to remember that not everyone will be comfortable with your history, and that's okay. The right person for you will accept and respect you for who you are, regardless of your past. Don't be afraid to weed out those who might have issues with your sexual history, as they are unlikely to be a good match for you in the long run.

Ultimately, honesty and openness are key to building trust and intimacy in any relationship. By being upfront about your past, you can avoid any potential misunderstandings or conflicts down the line and increase your chances of finding someone who is a good match for you.

### Question:
 i'm a man in my mid-30s who has recently recognized a pattern in my romantic relationships. a few of them lasted for several years, before they ended for various reasons. in between, i've gone a couple of years before seeking out and starting a new relationship. in the in-between time, i go online and meet people i have no intention of meeting in "real life," but who provide conversation and intimacy while i enjoy single life. i'm about to repeat the pattern again. i'm a few months out of a three-year relationship and have met someone online. it's great to chat online and over the phone, but we are not close geographically, and i have no intention of meeting in person. what's your insight on this, and do you think this is healthy for me? any ideas you can offer regarding this pattern? -- new relationships
### Answer:
  It sounds like you're enjoying the comfort and connection of online relationships without the commitment or pressure of in-person interactions. While there's nothing inherently wrong with this, it's important to recognize that these online connections may not fulfill all your emotional needs, especially if you're seeking a deeper, more intimate relationship.

It's also worth considering whether this pattern is helping or hindering your ability to form meaningful connections in real life. Are you using online relationships as a way to avoid the vulnerability and risk that comes with in-person relationships? Are there unresolved issues or fears that are keeping you from pursuing relationships with people you meet in person?

It might be helpful to take some time to reflect on what you're looking for in a relationship and what's holding you back from seeking it out. Consider talking to a therapist or trusted friend to explore these questions further. Additionally, try to strike up conversations with people you meet in person, whether through hobbies or social events, to practice building connections without the safety net of online communication.

Ultimately, it's important to find a balance between your online and offline relationships, ensuring that you're not relying solely on virtual connections for emotional fulfillment. By being aware of your motivations and taking small steps towards in-person connections, you can break the pattern of online-only relationships and potentially find more fulfilling relationships in the future.

### Question:
i'm 20 years old and have never dated anyone. i have a lot of friends and do well in school and at work, and i try to be a good, kind, friendly person. what can i do to make myself datable? am i missing some crucial step in how to become a girlfriend? -- old maid in st. louis
### Answer:
  It's great that you have a strong foundation of friends and are doing well in various aspects of your life! Becoming "datable" isn't about checking off a list of qualifications, but rather about being open to opportunities and cultivating healthy relationships. Here are some suggestions:

1. Expand your social circle: Attend events, join clubs or groups that align with your interests, and consider online dating. This will increase your chances of meeting potential partners.
2. Practice self-awareness: Understand your values, goals, and what you want in a partner. This will help you identify compatible matches and communicate effectively in relationships.
3. Develop strong communication skills: Work on active listening, expressing yourself clearly, and being receptive to feedback. These skills are essential for building strong connections.
4. Be open-minded: Don't limit yourself to a specific "type" or ideal partner. Be willing to give people a chance and explore different personalities and interests.
5. Embrace your uniqueness: Celebrate what makes you special and don't try to conform to societal expectations. Confidence and authenticity are attractive qualities in a partner.
6. Take care of yourself: Prioritize self-care, physical health, and personal growth. A happy and fulfilled individual is more likely to attract a compatible partner.
7. Be patient: Focus on enjoying the process of meeting new people and developing connections. Don't stress about finding a girlfriend; it will happen naturally when the time is right.

Remember, becoming datable is not a one-size-fits-all solution. By working on yourself and putting yourself out there, you'll increase your chances of finding a fulfilling relationship.

### Question:
it seems i will never meet my "mr. right." every person i'm attracted to is either in a relationship or doesn't like me. my questions are: (a) when is it ok to just "settle"? and (b) do you have to be attracted to your mr. right, and/or can you take the risk that the "supposed" sparkle/love will come in time? -- tired of dating, landover, md.
### Answer:
  Dear Tired of Dating,

I understand your frustration with the dating scene, but I would advise against settling for someone who doesn't meet your standards or expectations. Settling can lead to resentment and dissatisfaction in the long run.

Instead, consider taking a break from dating to focus on yourself and what you want in a partner. Work on building your self-esteem, pursuing your interests, and developing healthy habits. This will not only make you a more confident and fulfilled person but may also attract potential partners who share your values and interests.

Regarding attraction, it's important to remember that love and attraction can grow over time. You don't necessarily need to feel an instant spark or connection with someone to have a successful relationship. However, it's crucial to have mutual respect, trust, and communication in any partnership.

Ultimately, the decision to settle or hold out for someone you're truly compatible with is yours alone. But I encourage you to prioritize your own personal growth and development, and not compromise on qualities that are important to you in a partner.

Best regards,

### Question:
my boyfriend, "clay," and i recently met another couple, "doreen" and "bob," who let us know they're interested in socializing together. i like the concept of double-dating. it has a different social dynamic than hanging out with clay's or my single friends. at first we enjoyed our time with them. we met twice for dinner that first month. however, lately we've been feeling pressured. doreen sends four or five e-mails during the week and then a few text messages asking about our plans and if we want to meet them on saturday. i have tried to explain that we can't afford to go out every weekend and that clay and i sometimes have other plans. i have told them i'd be willing to host a game night or rent a movie, but i get the impression they consider it an insult. the issue here is that we don't like being pushed. one text or e-mail toward the end of the week is plenty for us. but receiving several inquiries all week makes us feel trapped. we have our own projects, friends and activities. we can't spend every weekend with this couple. as much as we enjoy spending time with them, how can we politely let them know that it is becoming too much? -- in demand in annapolis
### Answer:
  It's understandable that you and your boyfriend feel pressured by the constant communication from Doreen and Bob. It's important to set boundaries and communicate your needs clearly. Here's a suggestion:

Send a friendly email or text message to Doreen, expressing your appreciation for their enthusiasm, but also mentioning that you and Clay have other commitments and can't always meet up every weekend. You could say something like:

"Hey Doreen, hope you're doing well! I wanted to touch base with you about our social plans. While we really enjoy spending time with you and Bob, we have our own projects, friends, and activities that we need to prioritize. We'd love to host a game night or movie night at our place sometime, but we can't always meet up every weekend. Let's plan to catch up every other week or so, and we can exchange numbers to make it easier to coordinate. Looking forward to hearing from you!"

Remember to be polite, friendly, and assertive in your communication. It's important to maintain a positive relationship with this couple, but also establish boundaries that work for both parties.

### Question:
i am newly single after a 30-year marriage. would you please explain to me the protocol regarding intimacy? after how many dates is it appropriate to engage in intimacy? and afterward, should the man call the woman or the woman call the man? how long should one wait before calling? i'm afraid if i call too soon i'll appear needy, and if i wait too long to call i'll appear to be a player. -- tentative tom in tampa
### Answer:
  Hi Tom,

Congrats on your newfound single status! I understand your concerns about navigating intimacy post-divorce. There's no one-size-fits-all answer to your questions, as everyone's comfort levels and preferences vary. However, here are some general guidelines to consider:

1. Intimacy: It's essential to communicate openly with your partner about your desires, boundaries, and expectations. Don't rush into anything that makes you or your partner uncomfortable. Take the time to build a genuine connection and establish mutual respect. There's no specific number of dates that marks the "right" time for intimacy; it's more about getting to know each other and feeling comfortable with the progression of your relationship.
2. Communication: After an intimate encounter, it's important to communicate openly and honestly with your partner. Discuss what you both want and expect from the relationship moving forward. Don't play games or wait for the other person to make the first move. Be respectful and direct in your communication.
3. Calling/Texting: There's no strict rule about who should initiate contact after a date or intimate encounter. It's a good idea to communicate openly with your partner about your expectations regarding communication. If you want to talk or text, go for it! Just be respectful of the other person's time and boundaries. Avoid overthinking it – simply be yourself and communicate in a way that feels natural and respectful.
4. Timing: Don't worry too much about appearing needy or playing hard-to-get. Focus on building a genuine connection and mutual respect. If you're unsure about the timing of your next conversation, consider this: would you enjoy talking to this person? Do you have something meaningful to discuss? If so, go ahead and reach out.

Remember, Tom, relationships are about finding a compatible partner with whom you can build a healthy, fulfilling connection. Take things at your own pace, communicate openly, and prioritize mutual respect. Good luck!

### Question:
i do online dating. for safety, i use an alias. i look much younger than my 43 years, so i went out with a 29-year-old who thinks i'm 33. i have horrible luck with relationships and didn't think this one would be any different. boy, was i wrong! we have been dating three weeks now. how do i tell him i'm 43, have two kids he doesn't know about and a different name? or should i just break it off now? -- incognito in mississippi
### Answer:
  It's great that you've found a connection with someone! Honesty is important in any relationship, but it's especially important to be honest about who you are and your situation early on. I would suggest having an open and honest conversation with the person you're dating about your real name, age, and children. It's better to have this conversation now rather than later when emotions are more invested. Be prepared for the possibility that he may not be comfortable with the truth and may end the relationship. However, it's better to know now rather than later if you're compatible. Good luck!

### Question:
how do you attract single women while on a budget? -- gary in longwood, fla.
### Answer:
  Gary,

Attracting single women on a budget can be challenging, but there are ways to do it without breaking the bank. Here are some tips:

1. Be confident and respectful: Above all, women want to feel appreciated and respected. Show genuine interest in getting to know them, and treat them with kindness and respect.
2. Develop your social skills: Work on building meaningful connections by engaging in stimulating conversations, active listening, and being present in the moment.
3. Free or low-cost activities: Instead of expensive dates, try free or low-cost activities like going for a walk, having a picnic, or visiting a local museum or park.
4. Be creative: Use your imagination to come up with unique and fun date ideas that won't break the bank. For example, you could have a movie night at home, play board games, or go on a scavenger hunt.
5. Online dating: Consider using online dating apps or websites, which can be an affordable way to meet women with similar interests.
6. Be honest and upfront: Communicate your budget constraints with potential partners and be open about what you can and cannot afford.
7. Focus on shared interests: Find common ground and shared interests that don't require a lot of money to enjoy together, such as hiking, reading, or cooking.
8. Build a strong profile: Use your online dating profile to showcase your personality, interests, and what you're looking for in a partner. This will help attract women who share your values and are interested in getting to know you.
9. Take advantage of happy hour: Many restaurants offer happy hour specials that can be a great way to enjoy a date without breaking the bank.
10. Be patient: Building meaningful relationships takes time, so don't get discouraged if it doesn't happen overnight. Keep working on yourself, and eventually, you'll find someone special.

Remember, Gary, attracting women is not just about money; it's about building genuine connections, being respectful, and showing interest in getting to know them. Good luck!

### Question:
how do you respond if you're dating a much older man and someone asks if he is your father? -- the younger woman in vero beach, fla.
### Answer:
  If someone asks if the older man you're dating is your father, it's important to remember that their comment is likely rooted in societal norms and expectations around age differences in relationships. While it may be tempting to respond with a snarky or defensive comment, it's better to take the high road and avoid engaging with the other person's negativity. Instead, you could simply smile and say, "No, he's my partner" or "No, we're just dating." This response acknowledges the question without fueling any further discussion or criticism. It's also important to remember that your relationship is between you and your partner, and it's not anyone else's place to judge or comment on it.

### Question:
is there such a thing as "real love"? you know, the kind where you never feel complete unless your partner is there? i read books about this kind of love. i see movies about it and hear songs, but i have never experienced it. i am not a teen-ager, abby. i am 47 years old and wonder if i have missed out. -- wondering in iowa
### Answer:
  Dear Wondering in Iowa,

While the idea of "real love" as depicted in books, movies, and songs can be romantic, it's important to remember that relationships require more than just passion and chemistry to succeed. In reality, successful long-term relationships are built on a foundation of mutual respect, trust, and open communication.

It's never too late to find a fulfilling relationship, but it's essential to have realistic expectations. Focus on building a connection based on shared values, interests, and lifestyle. Don't worry too much about finding your "soulmate" or "the one." Instead, look for someone with whom you can build a healthy, happy partnership.

Remember that relationships take work and compromise. No partner will complete you; instead, they should complement and enhance your life. It's important to maintain your own identity, interests, and friendships outside of the relationship.

Don't give up on love, but approach it with a pragmatic and open-minded perspective. Keep working on yourself, building meaningful connections, and fostering healthy relationships. With time and effort, you may find a fulfilling partnership that brings joy and happiness to your life.

Best regards,
A Pragmatic Dating Advisor

### Question:
i am a divorced woman with one child, and i'm in a relationship with a younger man. he has his own home, and i have mine. he stays at my house three nights a week and every other weekend, when my child is not with me. he eats and grooms himself in my home and swims in the community pool. he never offers to pay for anything, like food, movie tickets, etc. if we go out, he expects me to pay my own way. in today's world is there any responsibility on a man in a relationship to pay for anything other than himself? are the days of men taking women out and paying for the date gone? shouldn't he offer to bring groceries during the times he spends at my home? what should a lady expect from a man in a dating relationship? -- gal in virginia
### Answer:
  It's important to remember that relationships are about mutual respect, communication, and realistic expectations. The idea that men should always pay for everything is outdated and can lead to unbalanced power dynamics in a relationship.

In today's world, it's common for couples to share expenses or take turns paying for things. It's not necessarily about gender roles, but rather about being respectful and considerate of each other's financial situations.

If you feel like your partner is not pulling their weight in terms of contributing financially, it's important to have an open and honest conversation about your expectations and concerns. It may be helpful to discuss how you can work together to create a fair and balanced system that works for both of you.

In terms of groceries, it would be reasonable to expect your partner to offer to bring some over during the times they spend at your home. However, it's also important to communicate your expectations and needs in this regard.

Ultimately, what a lady should expect from a man in a dating relationship is someone who is respectful, communicative, and willing to work together to build a healthy and balanced partnership.
