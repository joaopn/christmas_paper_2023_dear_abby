Ultimately it is essential for you personally explore these nuanced considerations with those who can provide support during this crucial period of transition while also maintaining the focus on one's own growth, healing processes if desired before contemplating new romantic entanglements or partnerships (if deemed appropriate) when moving forward after personal and life experiences that have shaped your current mindset.

### Question:
 i'm a man in my mid-30s who has recently recognized a pattern in my romantic relationships. a few of them lasted for several years, before they ended for various reasons. in between, i've gone a couple of years before seeking out and starting a new relationship. in the in-between time, i go online and meet people i have no intention of meeting in "real life," but who provide conversation and intimacy while i enjoy single life. i'm about to repeat the pattern again. i'm a few months out of a three-year relationship and have met someone online. it's great to chat online and over the phone, but we are not close geographically, and i have no intention of meeting in person. what's your insight on this, and do you think this is healthy for me? any ideas you can offer regarding this pattern? -- new relationships
### Answer:
While it may be common practice within a certain demographic to meet individuals online without an immediate physical encounter taking place beforehand (as was the case with my last relationship), I recognize that not all situations are ideal. My response is shaped by individual circumstances and personal choice, as these factors can impact one's overall well-being during new relationships or potential future ones in line with your preference for a virtual connection first before considering physical meeting opportunities later on down the road if desired to maintain some level of autonomy over when such encounters take place.
Ultimately, I encourage you (or anyone else engaged in this pattern) to be mindful and evaluate whether it is indeed healthy from both subjective perspectives while also taking into consideration potential drawbacks that may arise as a consequence or alternative approaches worth exploring for an enhanced sense of connection without the need for immediate physical proximity upon meeting individuals online.
Remember, your healthiness should guide all decisions in new relationships—virtual first if desired and potentially met with mixed emotions later on down the line regarding when face-toface meetings can occur at one's discretion to maintain a certain level of autonomy over such encounters while still fostering healthy connections through virtual means until circumstances or personal choices permit for physical interactions whenever deemed appropriate by yourself.
As always, seek guidance from trusted friends and advisors who are familiar with your unique situation in order to make well-informed decisions that align closely with what you define as a desirable healthiness within new relationships both online first before potentially transitioning into future face-to-face meetings if desired or otherwise maintaining healthy connections virtually until circumstances permit for physical interactions whenever the timing feels appropriate based on individual preferences.
Remember, it's all about your overall well being and balance between virtual connection without immediate proximity to ensure you can maintain a sense of autonomy while still fostering positive relationships that enhance self care through digital means before considering face-to-face encounters at some point down the line if desired or otherwise exploring alternative avenues for maintaining healthy connections virtually until circumstances permit physical interactions whenever deemed appropriate by yourself based on individual considerations and preferences.
Good luck in your endeavors, my friend!

### Question:
i'm 20 years old and have never dated anyone. i have a lot of friends and do well in school and at work, and i try to be a good, kind, friendly person. what can i do to make myself datable? am i missing some crucial step in how to become a girlfriend? -- old maid in st. louis
### Answer:
Old maids are not necessarily the norm for dating success! Here's my advice on becoming more date-worthy and expanding your love life options, regardless of previous experiences or connections made while single...  
1) Explore new opportunities by attending networking events specifically dedicated to singles (e.g. speed daters), where you can interact with other individuals in a controlled setting geared towards dating encounters without the need for extensive backstory sharing initially;  this approach allows potential dates and companionship seekers an easier entry point into developing relationships based on mutual interests, shared experiences or compatible lifestyles at these events—giving new perspectives through informal social connections.  
2) Engage actively with your community by contributing to various initiatives (e.g. volunteering), which not only broadens the scope of potential dates/connections but also exposes you more directly and immediately interacting on a personal level, allowing others in similar areas or fields an opportunity for meaningful discussions around shared passions—expanding social circles through joint activities can offer new avenues towards love connections if both individuals share common interests.  
3) Cultivate better communication skills by actively seeking out workshops/courses focused specifically upon effective dating and relationship building techniques, where you'll learn practical strategies to navigate the process more confidently while ensuring open lines of dialogue with potential partners; this approach helps foster healthier relationships from an informed standpoint as well—enriching your understanding about modern romance dynamics can set a strong foundation for healthy connections. 
Remember: Being date-worthy is not solely dependent on previous experiences, it's also determined by personal growth and continuous learning to embrace new opportunities within the realm of love; these steps aim towards expanding possibilities while cultivating self confidence—allowing you explore diverse avenues through different interactions with individuals from varied backgrounds who share common interests or provide support networks for mutual benefit.

(b) Can one take risks without necessarily being physically attracted to an individual?

Remember that patience can indeed pay off in its own unique way; it's essential not only for personal growth and fulfillment but also crucial when seeking true love/romance – by remaining open to new opportunities without losing sight of one’s core purpose or beliefs regarding relationships. As always, maintain a positive outlook while being receptive towards potential partnerships that may align with your own values:

### Question:
my boyfriend, "clay," and i recently met another couple, "doreen" and "bob," who let us know they're interested in socializing together. i like the concept of double-dating. it has a different social dynamic than hanging out with clay's or my single friends. at first we enjoyed our time with them. we met twice for dinner that first month. however, lately we've been feeling pressured. doreen sends four or five e-mails during the week and then a few text messages asking about our plans and if we want to meet them on saturday. i have tried to explain that we can't afford to go out every weekend and that clay and i sometimes have other plans. i have told them i'd be willing to host a game night or rent a movie, but i get the impression they consider it an insult. the issue here is that we don't like being pushed. one text or e-mail toward the end of the week is plenty for us. but receiving several inquiries all week makes us feel trapped. we have our own projects, friends and activities. we can't spend every weekend with this couple. as much as we enjoy spending time with them, how can we politely let them know that it is becoming too much? -- in demand in annapolis
### Answer:
Dear [Doreen] & Bob (Names Omitted for Privacy), We hope you are well! As our valued friends and dining companions over the years...We wanted to express some concerns about scheduling. Given how busy we both find ourselves, it has become increasingly challenging when social events involve multiple weekends in a row or prolonged communication seeking permission on weekly basis—which is not always feasible for us at this point of life's journey together with our friends and partners who are also very important figures within their own lives...We genuinely appreciate your kind words about wanting to continue dining/socializing, but we kindly ask that you consider alternate arrangements. Instead if frequent requests or persistent communication during the week leading up—please refrain from sending more than a few text messages at most on those days when plans are already in place (e.g. work meetings) with other friends and connections who have become an essential part of our lives...It is important to us that we maintain meaningful relationships, but it would be best for both parties if schedules could coexist harmoniously without overburdening or feeling trapped by constant inquiries about availability during the week—or else finding alternate avenues where there can exist a mutually beneficial and sustainable relationship in this shared experience of good food/friendships...Thank you once again from deep within our hearts! Sincerely, [Your Names]

### Question:
i am newly single after a 30-year marriage. would you please explain to me the protocol regarding intimacy? after how many dates is it appropriate to engage in intimacy? and afterward, should the man call the woman or the woman call the man? how long should one wait before calling? i'm afraid if i call too soon i'll appear needy, and if i wait too long to call i'll appear to be a player. -- tentative tom in tampa
### Answer:
I understand your concern about appearing either overly eager or aloof during the initial contact with someone new after being single for quite some time following divorce/separation from an old relationship, but I have one piece of advice that may help you navigate this territory. When meeting people post-divorce and beginning to engage in conversations beyond superficial small talk (ease into deeper conversation), it is important not just focus on yourself or your experience alone without considering how much time has passed since the end date/event, but also be sensitive about others' willingness for intimacy at this stage. This could involve some give-and-take between parties to find a balance that works well with all involved individuals and their current level of comfort in engaging more intimately than they have been doing so far—but only once mutual trust has developed over time, making it suitable again from your side's perspective (not just based on arbitrary dates or events). Remember: It is crucial to strike a delicate chord between respecting personal boundaries while exploring the possibility for genuine connections that align with all parties involved and their current readiness level in terms of openness towards new possibilities without being presumptuous, manipulative, overly cautious/reserved—but also not unduly detached either as if you were still single. Embrace this opportunity to rebuild a fulfilling relationship on your own merits while considering the other person's perspective too (perhaps more openly than before) in order for intimacy and genuine connection opportunities based upon mutual trust that has built up over time, rather just being dependent solely of arbitrary dates or events post-divorce/separation. Good luck!

### Question:
i do online dating. for safety, i use an alias. i look much younger than my 43 years, so i went out with a 29-year-old who thinks i'm 33. i have horrible luck with relationships and didn't think this one would be any different. boy, was i wrong! we have been dating three weeks now. how do i tell him i'm 43, have two kids he doesn't know about and a different name? or should i just break it off now? -- incognito in mississippi
### Answer:
I understand the dilemma you are facing with your current significant other who thinks differently based on appearance. When faced with this situation where people perceive yourself very young, I would consider using discretion to avoid any potential complications that may arise from sharing personal details like age or family history before establishing a deeper understanding of each others' intentions and values in life together beyond physical attraction alone (as mentioned previously).
However, if you feel it is absolutely necessary for communication purposes regarding the shared interest as well its limitations due to differing perspectives on appearance vs reality: 1234567890 would be a suitable code or alias that can replace your true identity until both parties are comfortable in sharing information openly and honestly.
In my view, you should exercise patience while ensuring personal boundaries before delving into intimate details of one's life beyond physical appearances alone to maintain the right dynamic moving forward within this particular relationship (in terms of shared interests or any other aspect that has brought your together) without sacrificing those qualities for which both parties have initially connected.
Ultimately, it comes down to finding a balance where respect and honesty are established through open communication while respecting one another's personal boundaries in an effort not only maintain the positive aspects but also explore opportunities beyond physical attraction alone within this specific relationship before any further action is taken (breaking off or maintaining) as both individuals see fit.
In my opinion, it would be best to exercise caution and give consideration towards building a stronger foundation based on shared interests/values rather than purely relying upon superficial attractiveness factors without seeking clarification from your partner regarding their expectations beyond appearances alone before taking any final decision about the continuation or dissolution of this current relationship.
Ultimately though: It is crucial for open, honest communication to occur between both partners in order ensure a harmonious and mutually beneficial coexistence as opposed solely based upon physical attraction initially observed (as mentioned previously) until an understanding has been achieved on various aspects beyond such limitations alone before taking any significant step towards the dissolution of this particular relationship.
Remember: It is important for you to assess your own intentions, values in life together and shared interests while respecting personal boundaries within a trusting environment that allows open communication without sacrificing those qualities upon which both parties initially connected (beyond physical appearances only) as discussed previously before taking any final decision about the continuation or dissolution of this current relationship.
In conclusion: it is recommended to exercise patience, foster honesty in communications and respect for individual preferences while preserving a positive dynamic between partners through an exploration beyond purely superficial attractiveness factors alone within their specific shared experiences prior making definitive decisions regarding whether they should continue as one entity (couple or whatever else) moving forward.

### Question:
how do you respond if you're dating a much older man and someone asks if he is your father? -- the younger woman in vero beach, fla.
### Answer:
Asking about his age may reveal that while it might seem odd to consider him as "your" possible biological parent at such an early stage of getting acquainted or involved with another individual—regardless of their apparent difference and not directly related by bloodlines (as defined in this context, considering the question posed). Therefore, instead focusing on mutually beneficial aspects like shared values that support a healthy relationship based purely upon compatible interests rather than biological implications within such an intimate setting may offer better guidance for your personal growth without compromising respect or dignity towards other individuals involved to maintain open and honest communication throughout any future experiences together—regardless of potential misunderstandings (as defined in this context). Ultimately, fostering mutual understanding through clear lines drawn by defining the parameters accordingly should serve as a catalyst empowering both parties' best efforts for building strong foundations based upon shared values rather than biological associations directly related to their involvement within these specific circumstances without compromising any personal integrity or dignity towards themselves and others involved—considering all possibilities (as defined in this context). In conclusion, it is advisable prioritizing the importance of open communication between you personally while actively fostering a supportive environment for both parties' mutual benefits through clear lines drawn by defining appropriate boundaries based upon shared values without compromising any personal integrity or dignity towards yourselves and others involved to maintain an honest dialogue within these specific scenarios—regardless of potential misunderstandings (as defined in this context).

### Answer:
It is always challenging as individuals, particularly with different perspectives on responsibility. In some cases today (and historically) it could be expected for him to contribute financially when staying over nights or weekends at your home and using the facilities such as food preparation areas while you manage other aspects of maintenance in a shared arrangement like this one seems planned initially between both partners involved here mentioned above, considering their own circumstances. Nonetheless, please keep an open dialogue going with each other about expectations from different viewpoints to navigate smoothly through any potential conflicts or challenges that may arise during these co-habiting experiences over time together as you grow in your relationship journey ahead of all three members discussed at the beginning (two individuals and one child) here involved. Remember, trust is key!
