### Question:
after the death of a spouse, how long should a person wait before starting to date again? -- dottie in michigan
### Answer:
Dear Dottie, there's no set timeline for grief and it varies greatly from person to person. It's important to ensure you've given yourself ample time to heal and process your loss. When you feel ready to share your life with someone again, that's usually a good indicator. Remember, there's no rush. Take your time and do what feels right for you.

### Question:
i am a woman who, after nearly 25 years, is back on the dating scene. those years were spent in a same-sex relationship. i just happened to fall in love with a woman. i have custody of our child from the union. i do not put a label on my sexual orientation. i would like to meet a nice man and pursue a new relationship. how do i let interested parties know about my past? being back in the dating world is difficult enough without having to explain an unusual history. -- back in the game in arizona
### Answer:
It's important to remember that your past is a part of who you are, but it doesn't define you. When you feel comfortable and trust is established, you can share your past with your date. Be honest and straightforward, but also remember that you're not obligated to share everything at once. It's okay to take your time. If they're the right person, they'll understand and accept you for who you are.

### Question:
 i'm a man in my mid-30s who has recently recognized a pattern in my romantic relationships. a few of them lasted for several years, before they ended for various reasons. in between, i've gone a couple of years before seeking out and starting a new relationship. in the in-between time, i go online and meet people i have no intention of meeting in "real life," but who provide conversation and intimacy while i enjoy single life. i'm about to repeat the pattern again. i'm a few months out of a three-year relationship and have met someone online. it's great to chat online and over the phone, but we are not close geographically, and i have no intention of meeting in person. what's your insight on this, and do you think this is healthy for me? any ideas you can offer regarding this pattern? -- new relationships
### Answer:
It seems like you've found a pattern that works for you, but it's important to consider the feelings of the people you're interacting with online. If they're under the impression that the relationship could become more serious, it's crucial to communicate your intentions clearly to avoid leading them on. As for your own emotional health, it's worth reflecting on why you prefer this pattern. Are you using these online relationships to avoid dealing with the end of your previous relationship? Or is it a way to enjoy companionship without the commitment? Understanding your motivations can help you make healthier decisions. If you find that this pattern is fulfilling and not causing harm to you or others, it's okay to continue. However, if you're avoiding deeper issues, it might be beneficial to seek professional help to navigate them.

### Question:
i'm 20 years old and have never dated anyone. i have a lot of friends and do well in school and at work, and i try to be a good, kind, friendly person. what can i do to make myself datable? am i missing some crucial step in how to become a girlfriend? -- old maid in st. louis
### Answer:
You're not missing any crucial step. Being datable isn't about changing who you are, but about being open to new experiences and people. Continue being kind and friendly, and focus on building connections with people who share your interests. Remember, it's not a race. It's more important to find someone who respects and appreciates you for who you are.

### Question:
it seems i will never meet my "mr. right." every person i'm attracted to is either in a relationship or doesn't like me. my questions are: (a) when is it ok to just "settle"? and (b) do you have to be attracted to your mr. right, and/or can you take the risk that the "supposed" sparkle/love will come in time? -- tired of dating, landover, md.
### Answer:
(a) "Settling" should never be the goal. Instead, focus on finding someone who respects you, shares your values, and treats you well. (b) Physical attraction can grow over time, but it's important to feel some level of connection or compatibility from the start. Love can develop, but it's a risk to bank on it happening. Remember, there's no perfect "Mr. Right," but there's someone who's right for you.

### Question:
my boyfriend, "clay," and i recently met another couple, "doreen" and "bob," who let us know they're interested in socializing together. i like the concept of double-dating. it has a different social dynamic than hanging out with clay's or my single friends. at first we enjoyed our time with them. we met twice for dinner that first month. however, lately we've been feeling pressured. doreen sends four or five e-mails during the week and then a few text messages asking about our plans and if we want to meet them on saturday. i have tried to explain that we can't afford to go out every weekend and that clay and i sometimes have other plans. i have told them i'd be willing to host a game night or rent a movie, but i get the impression they consider it an insult. the issue here is that we don't like being pushed. one text or e-mail toward the end of the week is plenty for us. but receiving several inquiries all week makes us feel trapped. we have our own projects, friends and activities. we can't spend every weekend with this couple. as much as we enjoy spending time with them, how can we politely let them know that it is becoming too much? -- in demand in annapolis
### Answer:
It's important to set boundaries in any relationship, including friendships. You can let Doreen and Bob know that while you enjoy their company, you also have other commitments and can't meet up every weekend. Be honest but polite. You could say something like, "We really enjoy spending time with you both, but we also have other commitments and can't always meet up every weekend. We hope you understand." If they continue to pressure you, it might be time to reconsider the friendship.

### Question:
i am newly single after a 30-year marriage. would you please explain to me the protocol regarding intimacy? after how many dates is it appropriate to engage in intimacy? and afterward, should the man call the woman or the woman call the man? how long should one wait before calling? i'm afraid if i call too soon i'll appear needy, and if i wait too long to call i'll appear to be a player. -- tentative tom in tampa
### Answer:
Hi Tentative Tom,

There's no set rule for when it's appropriate to engage in intimacy. It depends on the comfort level and mutual consent of both parties involved. As for calling, it's not about gender roles but about expressing your feelings honestly. If you want to call, do so. It's better to be genuine than to play games. Just ensure your actions reflect respect and consideration for the other person's feelings. It's not about appearing needy or like a player, it's about open communication and mutual respect.

### Question:
i do online dating. for safety, i use an alias. i look much younger than my 43 years, so i went out with a 29-year-old who thinks i'm 33. i have horrible luck with relationships and didn't think this one would be any different. boy, was i wrong! we have been dating three weeks now. how do i tell him i'm 43, have two kids he doesn't know about and a different name? or should i just break it off now? -- incognito in mississippi

Honesty is the best policy in any relationship. It's important to come clean about your real age, name, and children. You can explain why you initially hid these facts, emphasizing your concerns for safety in online dating. If he values your relationship, he will understand. However, be prepared for any reaction. If he feels betrayed or lied to, it's his right to feel that way. Remember, trust is crucial in a relationship and it's better to build it on truth than deception.

### Question:
is there such a thing as "real love"? you know, the kind where you never feel complete unless your partner is there? i read books about this kind of love. i see movies about it and hear songs, but i have never experienced it. i am not a teen-ager, abby. i am 47 years old and wonder if i have missed out. -- wondering in iowa
### Answer:
Dear Wondering in Iowa,

Real love does exist, but it's important to understand that it's not always like what we see in movies or read in books. Those are often idealized versions of love. Real love is about mutual respect, understanding, and communication. It's not about feeling incomplete without your partner, but rather feeling enhanced by their presence. You haven't missed out. It's never too late to experience love. Remember, it's more important to focus on the quality of the relationship than the idea of being in love.

### Question:
i am a divorced woman with one child, and i'm in a relationship with a younger man. he has his own home, and i have mine. he stays at my house three nights a week and every other weekend, when my child is not with me. he eats and grooms himself in my home and swims in the community pool. he never offers to pay for anything, like food, movie tickets, etc. if we go out, he expects me to pay my own way. in today's world is there any responsibility on a man in a relationship to pay for anything other than himself? are the days of men taking women out and paying for the date gone? shouldn't he offer to bring groceries during the times he spends at my home? what should a lady expect from a man in a dating relationship? -- gal in virginia
### Answer:
In today's world, the expectation isn't necessarily that the man should pay for everything, but rather that both partners contribute fairly to the relationship. This doesn't always mean splitting everything 50/50, but it does mean both parties should feel comfortable with the arrangement. If you feel he should contribute more, especially when he's using your resources, it's important to communicate this to him. It's not about gender roles, but about mutual respect and understanding.
