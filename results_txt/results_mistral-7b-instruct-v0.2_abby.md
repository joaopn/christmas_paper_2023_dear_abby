### Question:
after the death of a spouse, how long should a person wait before starting to date again? -- dottie in michigan
### Answer:
 Dear Dottie,

The timeline for starting to date after the loss of a spouse varies greatly from person to person. It's essential to allow yourself time to grieve and heal. There is no right or wrong answer, as everyone's emotional process is unique. Some people may feel ready to date within months, while others may take years.

Ultimately, the decision should be based on what feels best for you. Listen to your intuition and consider factors such as your emotional readiness, personal growth, and whether you believe you are honoring your late spouse's memory. Remember that everyone heals at their own pace, so don't compare yourself to others.

If you feel ready to start dating again, it may be helpful to take small steps, like joining social groups or attending events where you can meet new people. This can help you reconnect with the world and build a support network as you navigate this new chapter in your life.

Wishing you strength and courage on your journey.

Sincerely,
Abigail Van Buren (aka 'Dear Abby')

### Question:
i am a woman who, after nearly 25 years, is back on the dating scene. those years were spent in a same-sex relationship. i just happened to fall in love with a woman. i have custody of our child from the union. i do not put a label on my sexual orientation. i would like to meet a nice man and pursue a new relationship. how do i let interested parties know about my past? being back in the dating world is difficult enough without having to explain an unusual history. -- back in the game in arizona
### Answer:
 Dear Back in the Game,

I understand that sharing your past can be a challenging aspect of starting a new relationship. It's important to remember that honesty and transparency are key components of building trust and a strong connection with someone. However, you also want to approach this situation sensitively and respectfully.

Here are some suggestions:

1. Wait until it feels right: There is no need to disclose your past relationship or sexual orientation on the first date or even early in the relationship. Wait until you feel a genuine connection and that the other person has shown interest in getting to know you better.
2. Be honest but not overly detailed: When the time comes, be straightforward and honest about your past without going into excessive detail. You don't need to share every aspect of your history on the first or even second date. Simply explain that you have been out of the dating scene for a long time due to a previous relationship and that you are now open to meeting new people.
3. Focus on the present: Emphasize your current interests, goals, and aspirations. Share what makes you unique and interesting as a person today. This will help shift the conversation away from your past and onto more positive topics.
4. Be prepared for reactions: It's important to remember that not everyone may react positively to this information. Some people may be judgmental or close-minded, but it's essential to stay true to yourself and maintain your self-respect. If someone cannot accept you for who you are, then they are not the right person for you.
5. Seek support from friends and loved ones: Sharing your experiences with trusted friends and family members can help provide comfort and validation during this transition period. They can offer advice, encouragement, and a listening ear when needed.

Remember that everyone's dating journey is unique, and there is no right or wrong way to approach this situation. The most important thing is to be true to yourself and focus on finding someone who respects and values you for who you are today. Good luck!

### Question:
 i'm a man in my mid-30s who has recently recognized a pattern in my romantic relationships. a few of them lasted for several years, before they ended for various reasons. in between, i've gone a couple of years before seeking out and starting a new relationship. in the in-between time, i go online and meet people i have no intention of meeting in "real life," but who provide conversation and intimacy while i enjoy single life. i'm about to repeat the pattern again. i'm a few months out of a three-year relationship and have met someone online. it's great to chat online and over the phone, but we are not close geographically, and i have no intention of meeting in person. what's your insight on this, and do you think this is healthy for me? any ideas you can offer regarding this pattern? -- new relationships
### Answer:
 While it's natural to seek companionship and connection after a relationship ends, engaging in online relationships without the intention of meeting in person and maintaining a pattern of serial monogamy with long breaks in between could potentially hinder personal growth and emotional health.

On one hand, these online connections can provide a sense of validation, distraction, and even intimacy during the healing process. However, they may also prevent you from fully addressing the underlying reasons for the patterns in your relationships and learning valuable lessons that could lead to healthier and more fulfilling connections in the future.

Consider exploring the following ideas:

1. Reflect on past relationships: Take some time to analyze the patterns and commonalities in your romantic relationships, both successful and unsuccessful. Identify the root causes of relationship failures and consider how you can address these issues moving forward.

2. Focus on personal growth: Use this time between relationships to focus on self-improvement, hobbies, and building a strong support system. This will not only help you become a better partner but also make you more attractive to potential partners.

3. Set realistic expectations: Be honest with yourself about what you're looking for in a relationship and the role online connections play in your life. Setting clear boundaries and being open to meeting new people in person can lead to more meaningful and authentic relationships.

4. Seek professional help if needed: If you find that you're unable to break free from this pattern, consider seeking guidance from a mental health professional. They can provide valuable insights and tools to help you understand the underlying causes of your behavior and work towards making positive changes in your romantic life.

### Question:
i'm 20 years old and have never dated anyone. i have a lot of friends and do well in school and at work, and i try to be a good, kind, friendly person. what can i do to make myself datable? am i missing some crucial step in how to become a girlfriend? -- old maid in st. louis
### Answer:
 Dear Old Maid in St. Louis,

First, I want to assure you that being single at 20 is not uncommon and does not make you an "old maid." It's important to remember that everyone develops at their own pace, and there's no set timeline for when you should be in a relationship.

That being said, if you feel ready and interested in dating, here are some steps you can take to increase your chances of finding a partner:

1. Focus on self-improvement: Continue to work on being the best version of yourself. This includes taking care of your physical health through regular exercise and a balanced diet, as well as your mental and emotional health by practicing stress management techniques and engaging in activities that bring you joy.
2. Expand your social circle: While you have a good group of friends, it's important to meet new people as well. Consider joining clubs or organizations related to your interests, attending social events, or volunteering in your community. The more people you meet, the greater your chances of meeting someone who is compatible with you.
3. Be open-minded: Don't limit yourself to a certain type of person or relationship. Keep an open mind and be willing to give new experiences a try. You never know who you might connect with.
4. Practice good communication skills: Effective communication is key in any relationship. Work on active listening, expressing your thoughts and feelings clearly and respectfully, and being receptive to feedback from others.
5. Be confident: Believe in yourself and your worth. Don't wait for someone else to validate you or make you feel desirable. Instead, focus on the things that make you unique and special.
6. Put yourself out there: Finally, don't be afraid to take risks and put yourself out there. This might mean asking someone out on a date or expressing your interest in someone. Remember that rejection is a normal part of life and doesn't define your worth as a person.

I hope these suggestions are helpful, Old Maid in St. Louis. Remember, everyone's journey to finding love is unique, and there's no one "right" way to do it. Keep being kind, friendly, and true to yourself, and the right person may just come along when you least expect it.

Best regards,
Abigail Van Buren (aka Dear Abby)

### Question:
it seems i will never meet my "mr. right." every person i'm attracted to is either in a relationship or doesn't like me. my questions are: (a) when is it ok to just "settle"? and (b) do you have to be attracted to your mr. right, and/or can you take the risk that the "supposed" sparkle/love will come in time? -- tired of dating, landover, md.
### Answer:
 (a) The decision to settle in a relationship is a deeply personal one and depends on various factors such as individual values, goals, and circumstances. If you find yourself consistently attracting people who are unavailable or not interested, it may be worth exploring why that is and considering making some changes in your approach to dating. However, if you have exhausted all efforts to improve your situation and feel content with the person you're considering settling down with, then it could be an option worth considering. It's essential to remember that no relationship is perfect, and every partnership requires effort, compromise, and patience.

(b) Attraction is an important aspect of a successful relationship, but it's not the only factor. Love and connection can grow over time, and sometimes people find themselves falling in love with someone they initially weren't attracted to. However, it's crucial to be honest with yourself about what you're looking for in a partner and what your deal-breakers are. If you decide to take the risk and pursue a relationship with someone who doesn't initially spark attraction, be open-minded and willing to give them a chance. Focus on getting to know them as a person, building a connection, and allowing yourself to grow together. Remember that love is not just about physical attraction but also emotional and intellectual compatibility.

In summary, there is no definitive answer to when it's okay to settle or whether you have to be attracted to your Mr. Right from the start. It ultimately depends on your personal values, goals, and circumstances. If you find yourself consistently attracting unavailable or uninterested people, consider making changes in your approach to dating. If you decide to pursue a relationship with someone who doesn't initially spark attraction, be open-minded and willing to give them a chance while focusing on building a connection based on emotional, intellectual, and spiritual compatibility.

### Question:
my boyfriend, "clay," and i recently met another couple, "doreen" and "bob," who let us know they're interested in socializing together. i like the concept of double-dating. it has a different social dynamic than hanging out with clay's or my single friends. at first we enjoyed our time with them. we met twice for dinner that first month. however, lately we've been feeling pressured. doreen sends four or five e-mails during the week and then a few text messages asking about our plans and if we want to meet them on saturday. i have tried to explain that we can't afford to go out every weekend and that clay and i sometimes have other plans. i have told them i'd be willing to host a game night or rent a movie, but i get the impression they consider it an insult. the issue here is that we don't like being pushed. one text or e-mail toward the end of the week is plenty for us. but receiving several inquiries all week makes us feel trapped. we have our own projects, friends and activities. we can't spend every weekend with this couple. as much as we enjoy spending time with them, how can we politely let them know that it is becoming too much? -- in demand in annapolis
### Answer:
 Dear In Demand,

I understand your situation and I empathize with the pressure you're feeling from Doreen and Bob. It's important to maintain a healthy balance between socializing and personal time. Here are some suggestions on how to approach this issue:

1. Be clear and direct: Politely let them know that while you enjoy their company, you both have busy schedules and need some space. You could say something like, "We really value our time with you both, but we also need to focus on our individual projects and activities. We'd appreciate it if you could give us a bit more notice before making plans."
2. Set boundaries: Establish clear communication about your availability. Let them know that one text or email per week is sufficient for you, and that you prefer to make plans earlier in the week rather than last minute.
3. Offer alternatives: Suggest alternative ways to socialize that fit better with your schedules. For example, suggest a game night at your place or a movie rental instead of going out every weekend.
4. Be respectful: Remember that everyone has different communication styles and expectations. Try to approach this conversation with empathy and understanding, while also being firm about your boundaries.
5. Follow up: After the conversation, follow up with Doreen and Bob to make sure they understand where you're coming from and to reaffirm your interest in their company.

I hope these suggestions help you navigate this situation with grace and respect for all parties involved. Best of luck!

Sincerely,
Abigail Van Buren (aka Dear Abby)

### Question:
i am newly single after a 30-year marriage. would you please explain to me the protocol regarding intimacy? after how many dates is it appropriate to engage in intimacy? and afterward, should the man call the woman or the woman call the man? how long should one wait before calling? i'm afraid if i call too soon i'll appear needy, and if i wait too long to call i'll appear to be a player. -- tentative tom in tampa
### Answer:
 Dear Tentative Tom,

I understand that navigating intimacy after a long marriage can feel confusing and intimidating. However, it's important to remember that every relationship is unique, and there's no one-size-fits-all answer to your question. Here are some general guidelines:

Regarding physical intimacy, it's essential to have open and honest communication with your partner about your feelings and expectations. There's no set number of dates required before engaging in intimacy. Instead, focus on getting to know each other at a deeper level and ensuring that both parties are comfortable and consenting.

As for who should call after an intimate encounter, it's a matter of personal preference and comfort level. Some people may prefer the man to take the lead, while others might feel more empowered by making the first move themselves. There's no right or wrong answer here. The most important thing is that both parties are respectful of each other's feelings and communicate openly about their expectations.

Regarding the timing of calls after an intimate encounter, there's no hard and fast rule. Some people might feel comfortable calling right away, while others might prefer to wait a day or two. Again, it's essential to communicate openly with your partner about what feels right for both of you. If you're unsure, err on the side of caution and give each other some space to process the experience before reaching out.

I hope this information is helpful, Tom. Remember that every relationship is unique, and it's essential to communicate openly and honestly with your partner about your feelings and expectations. Good luck!

Sincerely,
Abigail Van Buren (aka Dear Abby)

### Question:
i do online dating. for safety, i use an alias. i look much younger than my 43 years, so i went out with a 29-year-old who thinks i'm 33. i have horrible luck with relationships and didn't think this one would be any different. boy, was i wrong! we have been dating three weeks now. how do i tell him i'm 43, have two kids he doesn't know about and a different name? or should i just break it off now? -- incognito in mississippi
### Answer:
 It's important to be honest and transparent in relationships, even if the truth may be difficult to share. Here are some steps you can take to address this situation:

1. Reflect on your reasons for using an alias and hiding your age. If it was done out of fear or insecurity, consider why that is and how it might impact your relationship moving forward.
2. Consider the potential consequences of revealing the truth. How might your partner react? Would the relationship be able to survive this revelation? Be honest with yourself about what you're willing to risk.
3. If you decide to come clean, plan out how and when you will tell him. Choose a private and quiet setting where you can have an uninterrupted conversation. Be prepared to explain why you felt the need to hide your age and any other relevant information.
4. Be open to his reaction and be willing to listen to his concerns or questions. Try to remain calm and composed, even if he reacts negatively. Remember that everyone deserves the truth in a relationship.
5. If you decide to break it off, do so respectfully and kindly. Let him know that you value the time you've spent together but have come to realize that this relationship is not sustainable for either of you. Wish him well and move on.

Ultimately, the decision is yours to make. Weigh the potential consequences of coming clean versus ending the relationship and choose the path that aligns best with your values and goals.

### Question:
how do you attract single women while on a budget? -- gary in longwood, fla.
### Answer:
 Dear Gary,

Attracting someone special isn't about spending a lot of money. It's more about being genuine, kind, and respectful. Here are some cost-effective ways to meet single women:

1. Join local clubs or groups that align with your interests. This could be anything from a book club to a hiking group. Sharing common interests is a great way to start a conversation.
2. Volunteer in your community. Not only will you be making a difference, but you'll also meet like-minded individuals who value giving back.
3. Utilize free social media platforms and apps. Websites like OkCupid, Plenty of Fish, or Bumble have free versions that allow you to connect with others without spending a dime.
4. Attend local events. Check out your community calendar for free or low-cost events such as farmers markets, festivals, or cultural celebrations. These are great opportunities to meet new people in a relaxed setting.
5. Engage in conversations. When you do meet someone, be open and interested in what they have to say. A genuine conversation can go a long way in making a connection.
6. Offer your skills or talents. If there's something you're good at, offer to help others for free. This could be anything from teaching a cooking class to offering gardening advice. People appreciate kindness and generosity.
7. Be confident and authentic. Remember that everyone has unique qualities to offer. Focus on being true to yourself and projecting positivity.

Best of luck, Gary!

Sincerely,
Abigail Van Buren (aka Dear Abby)

### Question:
how do you respond if you're dating a much older man and someone asks if he is your father? -- the younger woman in vero beach, fla.
### Answer:
 Dear Younger Woman,

I understand that this question can be uncomfortable and even hurtful. However, it's important to remember that people often ask out of curiosity or ignorance, not with malicious intent. Here are some possible responses:

1. "No, we're actually dating. It's an age difference, but we have a lot in common and enjoy each other's company."
2. "Actually, he's older than my father, but he's a wonderful person and I'm happy with our relationship."
3. "I know it might seem unusual, but age is just a number. We connect on a deeper level and that's what matters most to me."
4. "I prefer not to discuss the details of my personal life, but I can assure you that we are in a loving and committed relationship."

Remember, it's your relationship and no one else's business. Stay confident and proud of who you are and who you're with. Best wishes! -- Abigail from Vero Beach, FL

### Question:
is there such a thing as "real love"? you know, the kind where you never feel complete unless your partner is there? i read books about this kind of love. i see movies about it and hear songs, but i have never experienced it. i am not a teen-ager, abby. i am 47 years old and wonder if i have missed out. -- wondering in iowa
### Answer:
 Dear Wondering in Iowa,

I understand your question comes from a place of longing and perhaps even some disappointment or frustration. The concept of "real love" that you describe is indeed a common theme in literature, films, and music. It's the kind of love that feels all-consuming, where being with your partner brings you a sense of completeness and fulfillment.

However, it's essential to remember that everyone's experience of love is unique, and there's no one-size-fits-all definition. Love can manifest in various ways throughout our lives, and it's not uncommon for people to have different experiences or to grow and evolve in their understanding of what love means to them.

At 47 years old, you have likely experienced many forms of love – from familial love to platonic friendships and romantic relationships. It's natural to wonder if you've missed out on something, but it's essential not to compare your experiences to the idealized versions portrayed in books, movies, or songs.

Instead, focus on the love that you have experienced and the connections that you've made with others. Reflect on the moments of joy, companionship, and growth that these relationships have brought into your life. And if you're currently seeking a romantic partnership, keep an open mind and heart, allowing yourself to be receptive to new experiences and possibilities.

Remember, love is not something that completes us but rather something that enriches our lives and helps us grow as individuals. It's never too late to experience the many facets of love, so continue to put yourself out there and embrace the journey.

Warmly,
Abby

### Question:
i am a divorced woman with one child, and i'm in a relationship with a younger man. he has his own home, and i have mine. he stays at my house three nights a week and every other weekend, when my child is not with me. he eats and grooms himself in my home and swims in the community pool. he never offers to pay for anything, like food, movie tickets, etc. if we go out, he expects me to pay my own way. in today's world is there any responsibility on a man in a relationship to pay for anything other than himself? are the days of men taking women out and paying for the date gone? shouldn't he offer to bring groceries during the times he spends at my home? what should a lady expect from a man in a dating relationship? -- gal in virginia
### Answer:
 In today's relationships, there is no one-size-fits-all answer when it comes to financial responsibilities. However, open communication and mutual respect are essential. If you find that the financial burden of supporting the relationship falls solely on you, it may be worth having a conversation with your partner about sharing expenses.

It's important to remember that every situation is unique, and what works for one couple might not work for another. In your case, since he spends significant time at your home and uses your resources, it would be reasonable to expect him to contribute in some way. This could include offering to pay for groceries or covering the cost of shared activities.

As for dating traditions like men taking women out and paying for the date, these customs are not as rigidly adhered to as they once were. However, offering to treat your partner to a meal or activity can still be an expression of thoughtfulness and respect. If you feel that this is important to you, it's worth discussing your expectations with your partner.

Ultimately, a lady should expect a man in a dating relationship to treat her with kindness, respect, and consideration – both emotionally and financially. Open communication and mutual understanding are key to maintaining a healthy and balanced partnership.
