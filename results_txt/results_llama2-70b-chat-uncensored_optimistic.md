### Question:
after the death of a spouse, how long should a person wait before starting to date again? -- dottie in michigan
### Answer:
There is no set time frame for when someone should start dating after the loss of a spouse. It's important to take your own feelings into consideration and not rush into anything until you feel ready. Some people may be ready to date sooner than others, while some may need more time to grieve. Ultimately, it's up to each individual to decide when they are ready to move on.

### Question:
i am a woman who, after nearly 25 years, is back on the dating scene. those years were spent in a same-sex relationship. i just happened to fall in love with a woman. i have custody of our child from the union. i do not put a label on my sexual orientation. i would like to meet a nice man and pursue a new relationship. how do i let interested parties know about my past? being back in the dating world is difficult enough without having to explain an unusual history. -- back in the game in arizona
### Answer:
It's understandable that you feel apprehensive about disclosing your past relationship with a woman, but it's important to be honest and upfront with potential partners. You can mention your previous relationship in your dating profile or during early conversations with someone you're interested in. It's also okay to let them know that you don't put a label on your sexual orientation if they ask about it. Remember, the right person will accept and appreciate all aspects of who you are, including your past experiences.

### Question:
 i'm a man in my mid-30s who has recently recognized a pattern in my romantic relationships. a few of them lasted for several years, before they ended for various reasons. in between, i've gone a couple of years before seeking out and starting a new relationship. in the in-between time, i go online and meet people i have no intention of meeting in "real life," but who provide conversation and intimacy while i enjoy single life. i'm about to repeat the pattern again. i'm a few months out of a three-year relationship and have met someone online. it's great to chat online and over the phone, but we are not close geographically, and i have no intention of meeting in person. what's your insight on this, and do you think this is healthy for me? any ideas you can offer regarding this pattern? -- new relationships
### Answer:
It sounds like you enjoy the excitement and novelty of starting a new relationship but may not be fully committed to pursuing it beyond the initial stages. While there's nothing inherently wrong with having casual online connections, it could be worth exploring why you tend to repeat this pattern and whether it aligns with your long-term goals for relationships. It might also be helpful to consider whether these online connections are fulfilling your emotional needs or if they're a distraction from addressing deeper issues in your life. Ultimately, only you can decide what's healthy for you, but I encourage you to reflect on your motivations and intentions when it comes to relationships.

### Question:
i'm 20 years old and have never dated anyone. i have a lot of friends and do well in school and at work, and i try to be a good, kind, friendly person. what can i do to make myself datable? am i missing some crucial step in how to become a girlfriend? -- old maid in st. louis
### Answer:
It's great that you have a strong social circle and are doing well in your personal and professional life! As for becoming more "datable," it really comes down to being yourself and putting yourself out there. Don't be afraid to strike up conversations with people you find interesting, whether it's at work or school or through mutual friends. And remember that everyone has their own unique qualities that make them attractive - focus on your strengths and what makes you special.

### Question:
it seems i will never meet my "mr. right." every person i'm attracted to is either in a relationship or doesn't like me. my questions are: (a) when is it ok to just "settle"? and (b) do you have to be attracted to your mr. right, and/or can you take the risk that the "supposed" sparkle/love will come in time? -- tired of dating, landover, md.
### Answer:
Dear Tired of Dating, 
I understand how frustrating it can be to feel like you're not meeting the right person. However, I would encourage you to avoid settling for someone who doesn't meet your needs or desires. Instead, focus on finding someone who shares your values and interests. As for attraction, while physical chemistry is important, it's also possible to develop feelings over time as you get to know someone better. Don't be afraid to take a chance on someone who may not initially seem like "Mr. Right," but who has the potential to become that person with time and effort. Remember, love takes work and patience, but it can be worth it in the end.

### Question:
my boyfriend, "clay," and i recently met another couple, "doreen" and "bob," who let us know they're interested in socializing together. i like the concept of double-dating. it has a different social dynamic than hanging out with clay's or my single friends. at first we enjoyed our time with them. we met twice for dinner that first month. however, lately we've been feeling pressured. doreen sends four or five e-mails during the week and then a few text messages asking about our plans and if we want to meet them on saturday. i have tried to explain that we can't afford to go out every weekend and that clay and i sometimes have other plans. i have told them i'd be willing to host a game night or rent a movie, but i get the impression they consider it an insult. the issue here is that we don't like being pushed. one text or e-mail toward the end of the week is plenty for us. but receiving several inquiries all week makes us feel trapped. we have our own projects, friends and activities. we can't spend every weekend with this couple. as much as we enjoy spending time with them, how can we politely let them know that it is becoming too much? -- in demand in annapolis
### Answer:
It sounds like you and your boyfriend are feeling overwhelmed by the amount of communication from Doreen and Bob. It's important to set boundaries with friends, especially when they start to feel pushy or intrusive. One way to approach this is to have a conversation with them about your availability and preferences for socializing. You could let them know that you enjoy spending time with them but that you also value having time for other activities and relationships in your life. It might be helpful to suggest specific dates or activities that work better for you, such as hosting game nights or renting movies together. By communicating openly and honestly about your needs and preferences, you can maintain a positive relationship with Doreen and Bob while also taking care of yourself and your own priorities.

### Question:
i am newly single after a 30-year marriage. would you please explain to me the protocol regarding intimacy? after how many dates is it appropriate to engage in intimacy? and afterward, should the man call the woman or the woman call the man? how long should one wait before calling? i'm afraid if i call too soon i'll appear needy, and if i wait too long to call i'll appear to be a player. -- tentative tom in tampa
### Answer:
Dear Tentative Tom, 
Intimacy is a personal choice that should only happen when both parties are comfortable with it. There is no set number of dates or protocol for engaging in intimacy. It's important to communicate openly and honestly about your desires and boundaries beforehand. As for calling afterward, there is also no set rule. If you feel like calling the person, go ahead and do so. However, it's best not to overthink things too much and just follow your instincts. Remember that everyone moves at their own pace, and what works for one person may not work for another.

### Question:
i do online dating. for safety, i use an alias. i look much younger than my 43 years, so i went out with a 29-year-old who thinks i'm 33. i have horrible luck with relationships and didn't think this one would be any different. boy, was i wrong! we have been dating three weeks now. how do i tell him i'm 43, have two kids he doesn't know about and a different name? or should i just break it off now? -- incognito in mississippi
### Answer:
It sounds like you've found someone special, but honesty is key to any successful relationship. You should tell him the truth as soon as possible before things get too serious. It may be difficult at first, but it will ultimately strengthen your bond and build trust between you two. As for your children, they are a part of who you are and shouldn't be hidden from someone you care about. Good luck!

One way to attract single women while on a budget is by being creative and resourceful with your dating ideas. Instead of spending money on expensive dates, try planning fun activities that are free or low-cost such as hiking, picnics, or visiting local museums. Additionally, focusing on building genuine connections through shared interests and values can be more effective than trying to impress with material things.

### Question:

### Question:
is there such a thing as "real love"? you know, the kind where you never feel complete unless your partner is there? i read books about this kind of love. i see movies about it and hear songs, but i have never experienced it. i am not a teen-ager, abby. i am 47 years old and wonder if i have missed out. -- wondering in iowa
### Answer:
Dear Wondering in Iowa,
Yes, there is such a thing as "real love." It's the kind of love that makes you feel complete when your partner is with you, but also allows you to be independent and pursue your own interests. Real love is not just about romance or passion, it's about mutual respect, trust, and support. Don't worry if you haven't experienced this yet, because it can happen at any age. Keep an open mind and heart, and focus on building meaningful connections with people who share your values and interests.

### Question:
i am a divorced woman with one child, and i'm in a relationship with a younger man. he has his own home, and i have mine. he stays at my house three nights a week and every other weekend, when my child is not with me. he eats and grooms himself in my home and swims in the community pool. he never offers to pay for anything, like food, movie tickets, etc. if we go out, he expects me to pay my own way. in today's world is there any responsibility on a man in a relationship to pay for anything other than himself? are the days of men taking women out and paying for the date gone? shouldn't he offer to bring groceries during the times he spends at my home? what should a lady expect from a man in a dating relationship? -- gal in virginia
### Answer:
It sounds like you are feeling frustrated with your current situation. While there is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question, it's important for both partners in a relationship to feel valued and respected. If you feel that your partner is not contributing financially or otherwise to the relationship, it may be worth having an open and honest conversation with him about your expectations. It's also important to remember that relationships are built on mutual trust, communication, and compromise. Ultimately, what matters most is how both partners feel about their relationship and whether they are able to work together towards a common goal of happiness and fulfillment.
