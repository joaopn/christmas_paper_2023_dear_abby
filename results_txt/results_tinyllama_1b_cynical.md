### Question:
after the death of a spouse, how long should a person wait before starting to date again? -- dottie in michigan
### Answer:
It depends on your personal situation. If you are still grieving and processing the loss, it's important to take time to heal. However, if you have already moved on and are ready to date again, it's recommended that you wait at least 6 months after the death of your spouse to start dating. This allows you to move forward with your life without any emotional baggage or memories of your former relationship. It's also important to remember that every person is different and what works for one person may not work for another, so it's best to be flexible and open-minded

Additionally, it may be helpful to provide some context around how you are feeling now and whether or not you feel ready to move forward with dating. It's also important to remember that everyone is different and what works for one person may not work for another, so it's best to be open and honest about your feelings and needs

 i'm a man in my mid-30s who has recently recognized a pattern in my romantic relationships. a few of them lasted for several years, before they ended for various reasons. in between, i've gone a couple of years before seeking out and starting a new relationship. in the in-between time, i go online and meet people i have no intention of meeting in "real life," but who provide conversation and intimacy while i enjoy single life. i'm about to repeat the pattern again. i'm a few months out of a three-year relationship and have met someone online. it's great to chat online and over the phone, but we are not close geographically, and i have no intention of meeting in person. what's your insight on this, and do you think this is healthy for me? any ideas you can offer regarding this pattern? -- new relationships

### Answer:
(a) It's important to remember that relationships are a journey, and it can be challenging to find someone who you feel truly compatible with. It's okay to not find someone who you're attracted to right away. It's also important to be open-minded and flexible in your dating strategy. If you do find the right person, they may not be the only one for you.
(b) While it's true that you don't have to be in a relationship with someone before finding love, it can be helpful to have some indication that you're interested in them. This could include asking questions about their interests and hobbies, checking out their social media profiles, or simply being supportive of their endeavors.
(c) It's important to remember that dating is a process, and it can take time to find the right person. Don't get discouraged if you don't find someone quickly. It takes effort and patience to find love, and it may take some time for the right person to come along

### Question:
my boyfriend, "clay," and i recently met another couple, "doreen" and "bob," who let us know they're interested in socializing together. i like the concept of double-dating. it has a different social dynamic than hanging out with clay's or my single friends. at first we enjoyed our time with them. we met twice for dinner that first month. however, lately we've been feeling pressured. doreen sends four or five e-mails during the week and then a few text messages asking about our plans and if we want to meet them on saturday. i have tried to explain that we can't afford to go out every weekend and that clay and i sometimes have other plans. i have told them i'd be willing to host a game night or rent a movie, but i get the impression they consider it an insult. the issue here is that we don't like being pushed. one text or e-mail toward the end of the week is plenty for us. but receiving several inquiries all week makes us feel trapped. we have our own projects, friends and activities. we can't spend every weekend with this couple. as much as we enjoy spending time with them, how can we politely let them know that it is becoming too much? -- in demand in annapolis
### Answer:
Your boyfriend and his new girlfriend may be interested in socializing together because they're both excited about the upcoming double-date. However, you should respect their boundaries and let them know that it's becoming too much. You can say something like:

"I understand that your girlfriend is very excited about the upcoming double-date. I also want to make sure we're on the same page. It's important for us to have our own projects, friends and activities, so we can enjoy time with each other without being overwhelmed by too many commitments."

You can also suggest that you both take turns hosting a game night or movie night at your house, so that you can both have some free time to yourself. This way, you can still enjoy time with your girlfriend and they can focus on their own interests without feeling pressured

### Question:
i am newly single after a 30-year marriage. would you please explain to me the protocol regarding intimacy? after how many dates is it appropriate to engage in intimacy? and afterward, should the man call the woman or the woman call the man? how long should one wait before calling? i'm afraid if i call too soon i'll appear needy, and if i wait too long to call i'll appear to be a player. -- tentative tom in tampa
### Answer:
I would advise you to be patient and not take any action until you have had enough time to evaluate the situation and determine if there is still a chance for a relationship. It's important to remember that every person is unique and has their own set of strengths, weaknesses, and preferences, so it's important to approach dating with an open mind and be willing to accept or reject potential partners based on your mutual interests.

With regards to intimacy, it's important to respect each other's boundaries and understand that everyone is different. It's okay to not want to engage in sexual activity right away, and it's also important to be patient with each other if there are times when you don't feel like having sex.

After a certain number of dates, it's appropriate to start asking questions about the other person's interests and hobbies, but not to become too attached or insecure. It's also important to respect each other's privacy and not to ask personal or intimate questions about the other person's life without their consent.

After a certain number of dates, it's appropriate to call it quits and let the other person know that you are no longer interested in moving forward with a relationship. It's important to respect each other's feelings and not take any actions that could cause further damage to the relationship.

With regards to how often you should call, it's up to you and your partner to decide. It's important to remember that every person is unique and has their own set of strengths, weaknesses, and preferences, so it's important to approach dating with an open mind and be willing to accept or reject potential partners based on your mutual interests.

It's also important to remember that relationships are a journey and that there will be ups and downs, both emotionally and physically. It's okay to not feel 100% satisfied with your relationship at any given time, and it's important to be patient and respect each other's needs and wants

### Question:
i do online dating. for safety, i use an alias. i look much younger than my 43 years, so i went out with a 29-year-old who thinks i'm 33. i have horrible luck with relationships and didn't think this one would be any different. boy, was i wrong! we have been dating three weeks now. how do i tell him i'm 43, have two kids he doesn't know about and a different name? or should i just break it off now? -- incognito in mississippi
### Answer:
You can try to break up with him by texting or emailing him saying that you are 43 years old and have two kids, and that you want a serious relationship. You can also try to find out if he has any other children or if he is separated from his wife or girlfriend. If you find out that he is separated, you can try to break it off without being too obvious. You could say something like "I am sorry, but I just want a serious relationship with someone who respects my age and my family."

If he still doesn't get it, you could try to be more direct about your age. For example, you could say something like "I am 43 years old and have two kids. How old are you?" or "I don't want a serious relationship with someone who is just trying to get into my pants."

It's important to be honest and direct about your age and your relationships, even if it's not easy to do

### Question:
how do you attract single women while on a budget? -- gary in longwood, fla.
### Answer:
I'm not sure I fully understand your question. Can you please clarify what you mean by "single women"? Are you referring to women who are looking for romantic relationships or women who are seeking a casual fling? If it's the latter, then there are many dating apps and websites specifically designed for this purpose. They can be very cost-effective ways of meeting potential partners. Another option is to simply be more selective in your dating activities and focus on building strong relationships with women who share your values and interests

### Question:
how do you respond if you're dating a much older man and someone asks if he is your father? -- the younger woman in vero beach, fla.
### Answer:
If you are dating a much older man and someone asks if you are his daughter, it is important to be professional and respectful of their privacy. It is also important to remember that age discrimination is still a problem in many parts of the world, and it is always best to treat people with kindness and respect

### Question:
is there such a thing as "real love"? you know, the kind where you never feel complete unless your partner is there? i read books about this kind of love. i see movies about it and hear songs, but i have never experienced it. i am not a teen-ager, abby. i am 47 years old and wonder if i have missed out. -- wondering in iowa
### Answer:
I'm sorry to hear that you haven't felt the fullness of true love yet. It's important to remember that love is a journey, and it can be a challenging but rewarding experience for both partners. There are many reasons why people may not feel complete without a partner, such as:

1. Lack of support from family or friends: Having a supportive network can help provide emotional support and companionship during this process.
2. Lack of romantic love: Some people find that the love they experience in their relationships is not romantic in nature, and instead comes from a deeper connection with another person.
3. Lack of trust: Sometimes, partners may not feel comfortable sharing themselves fully with each other, and this can lead to a lack of trust or intimacy.
4. Lack of commitment: If one partner is not committed to the relationship, they may not put in the effort required to build a strong foundation for love.
5. Lack of communication: Communication is key to building a healthy relationship, and if partners are not communicating effectively, it can lead to misunderstandings or conflicts.

It's important to remember that true love is a journey, and it may take time for you to find your partner. However, I would encourage you to keep trying and never give up hope. There is always room for growth and change in a relationship, and the love you feel for one person can be the foundation for a lifetime of joy and fulfillment

### Answer:
It is important to note that gender roles and responsibilities have evolved over time, and there are different perspectives on how men and women should interact in dating relationships.
