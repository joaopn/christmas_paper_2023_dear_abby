### Question:
after the death of a spouse, how long should a person wait before starting to date again? -- dottie in michigan
### Answer:
Dottie, there's no one-size-fits-all timeline for when to start dating after the loss of a spouse. It's a deeply personal decision that depends on various factors, including emotional readiness, the nature of the previous relationship, and cultural or religious beliefs. Some people may feel ready after a few months, while others may take years. The key is to ensure you've given yourself time to grieve and to understand your own needs and feelings. It's also important to not rush into dating due to external pressures or loneliness. When you feel a sense of inner peace about the idea of meeting someone new and have the emotional capacity to engage with someone else's feelings, it might be the right time to explore dating.

### Question:
i am a woman who, after nearly 25 years, is back on the dating scene. those years were spent in a same-sex relationship. i just happened to fall in love with a woman. i have custody of our child from the union. i do not put a label on my sexual orientation. i would like to meet a nice man and pursue a new relationship. how do i let interested parties know about my past? being back in the dating world is difficult enough without having to explain an unusual history. -- back in the game in arizona
### Answer:
Welcome back to the dating scene! It's important to remember that your past relationship is just one part of your story. When it comes to sharing your history with potential partners, focus on honesty and timing. You don't need to disclose everything on a first date, but as you grow more comfortable and see potential in the relationship, have an open conversation.

Here's a simple approach:

1. **Timing**: Wait until you've had a few dates and you feel there's mutual interest.

2. **Honesty**: Be straightforward about your past in a matter-of-fact way. You might say something like, "I want to share something about my past that's important to me. I was in a long-term relationship with a woman, and we have a child together. That relationship taught me a lot, and I'm now looking to connect with someone new."

3. **Focus on the Present**: Emphasize who you are today and what you're looking for now. Your past has shaped you, but it doesn't define your future.

4. **Mutual Respect**: Gauge their reaction. A respectful partner will appreciate your openness and honesty.

Remember, the right person will accept your past as part of what makes you the unique individual you are today. Good luck!

### Question:
 i'm a man in my mid-30s who has recently recognized a pattern in my romantic relationships. a few of them lasted for several years, before they ended for various reasons. in between, i've gone a couple of years before seeking out and starting a new relationship. in the in-between time, i go online and meet people i have no intention of meeting in "real life," but who provide conversation and intimacy while i enjoy single life. i'm about to repeat the pattern again. i'm a few months out of a three-year relationship and have met someone online. it's great to chat online and over the phone, but we are not close geographically, and i have no intention of meeting in person. what's your insight on this, and do you think this is healthy for me? any ideas you can offer regarding this pattern? -- new relationships
### Answer:
Recognizing patterns in your behavior is a crucial step towards understanding your needs and motivations. It seems like you're using online interactions as a way to fill the gap between long-term relationships. This isn't inherently unhealthy, as long as you're honest with yourself and the people you're engaging with about your intentions.

However, consider the following:

1. **Reflection**: Ask yourself why you prefer online interactions in these periods. Is it a fear of commitment, a way to avoid the vulnerability of in-person connections, or simply a preference for the single lifestyle?

2. **Communication**: Ensure that the people you're talking to are aware of your intentions. It's important to avoid leading someone on if you have no plans to pursue a deeper relationship.

3. **Balance**: Make sure these online interactions aren't preventing you from pursuing other fulfilling activities or relationships that could contribute to your growth and happiness.

4. **Patterns**: If you're content with this pattern and it's not harming anyone, it might just be your personal rhythm of balancing intimacy and independence. If you're not content, consider exploring the underlying reasons with a therapist or counselor.

5. **Future Goals**: Reflect on what you want long-term. If you desire a lasting partnership eventually, consider whether this pattern is helping or hindering that goal.

Remember, healthy relationships, whether online or in-person, are built on mutual respect, clear communication, and shared expectations.

### Question:
i'm 20 years old and have never dated anyone. i have a lot of friends and do well in school and at work, and i try to be a good, kind, friendly person. what can i do to make myself datable? am i missing some crucial step in how to become a girlfriend? -- old maid in st. louis
### Answer:
Firstly, it's important to recognize that being 20 and not having dated isn't unusual or a sign that you're missing a "crucial step." Relationships happen at different times for everyone. To increase your chances of finding a relationship, consider the following:

1. **Self-Reflection**: Understand what you want in a partner and a relationship. This will help you navigate dating with more clarity.

2. **Social Opportunities**: Engage in activities and hobbies that interest you. This can expand your social circle and increase the likelihood of meeting someone with similar interests.

3. **Openness**: Be open to meeting new people and trying new experiences. Sometimes, stepping out of your comfort zone can lead to unexpected connections.

4. **Communication Skills**: Continue to develop your ability to communicate effectively. Being able to express your thoughts and feelings is key in a relationship.

5. **Confidence**: Believe in your worth and what you bring to a relationship. Confidence can be attractive to potential partners.

6. **Online Dating**: If you're comfortable with it, consider online dating. It can be a practical way to meet people who are also looking for a relationship.

Remember, there's no rush. Focus on being the best version of yourself, and a relationship will come when the time is right.

### Question:
it seems i will never meet my "mr. right." every person i'm attracted to is either in a relationship or doesn't like me. my questions are: (a) when is it ok to just "settle"? and (b) do you have to be attracted to your mr. right, and/or can you take the risk that the "supposed" sparkle/love will come in time? -- tired of dating, landover, md.
### Answer:
(a) Settling is a personal decision, but it's important to differentiate between settling for less than you deserve and having realistic expectations. If you're considering settling because you're tired of looking, you may want to reevaluate what you truly want and need in a partner. A fulfilling relationship should not feel like settling, but rather like a partnership that brings you happiness and growth, even if it doesn't match every ideal you've set.

(b) Attraction can be important, but it's not the only factor in a successful relationship. It can grow over time as you connect on deeper levels. However, there should be some level of physical or emotional attraction to build upon. Taking a risk on someone you're not initially attracted to is a personal choice, but ensure there's potential for a spark to develop. Mutual respect, shared values, and compatible life goals can be just as crucial as initial attraction.

### Question:
my boyfriend, "clay," and i recently met another couple, "doreen" and "bob," who let us know they're interested in socializing together. i like the concept of double-dating. it has a different social dynamic than hanging out with clay's or my single friends. at first we enjoyed our time with them. we met twice for dinner that first month. however, lately we've been feeling pressured. doreen sends four or five e-mails during the week and then a few text messages asking about our plans and if we want to meet them on saturday. i have tried to explain that we can't afford to go out every weekend and that clay and i sometimes have other plans. i have told them i'd be willing to host a game night or rent a movie, but i get the impression they consider it an insult. the issue here is that we don't like being pushed. one text or e-mail toward the end of the week is plenty for us. but receiving several inquiries all week makes us feel trapped. we have our own projects, friends and activities. we can't spend every weekend with this couple. as much as we enjoy spending time with them, how can we politely let them know that it is becoming too much? -- in demand in annapolis
### Answer:
It's important to set boundaries in any relationship, including those with new friends. Have an open and honest conversation with Doreen and Bob. Let them know that while you enjoy their company, you have various commitments and need to balance your social life with other responsibilities. Suggest scheduling a regular monthly get-together, so they know when to expect to see you next, and there's no pressure for weekly plans. Emphasize that this isn't a reflection of your enjoyment of their company but rather a need for balance in your life. Communication and honesty will help set the tone for a healthy friendship moving forward.

### Question:
i am newly single after a 30-year marriage. would you please explain to me the protocol regarding intimacy? after how many dates is it appropriate to engage in intimacy? and afterward, should the man call the woman or the woman call the man? how long should one wait before calling? i'm afraid if i call too soon i'll appear needy, and if i wait too long to call i'll appear to be a player. -- tentative tom in tampa
### Answer:
Hello Tentative Tom,

The protocol regarding intimacy varies greatly among individuals and is influenced by personal values, comfort levels, and mutual interest. There's no set number of dates after which intimacy is deemed appropriate. It's important to engage in open and honest communication with your partner about your feelings and expectations.

As for calling after intimacy, the old rules about who calls whom and waiting a certain number of days are outdated. It's best to be genuine and considerate. If you had a good time and want to see the person again, it's perfectly fine to reach out the next day to express that you enjoyed their company and would like to meet again. The key is to be respectful and not to overthink the timing too much. Mutual respect and clear communication are always in style.

Remember, every person and situation is different, so trust your instincts and focus on building a connection that's based on honesty and respect.

### Question:
i do online dating. for safety, i use an alias. i look much younger than my 43 years, so i went out with a 29-year-old who thinks i'm 33. i have horrible luck with relationships and didn't think this one would be any different. boy, was i wrong! we have been dating three weeks now. how do i tell him i'm 43, have two kids he doesn't know about and a different name? or should i just break it off now? -- incognito in mississippi
### Answer:
It's important to address this sooner rather than later. Honesty is the foundation of a healthy relationship. Plan a time to talk with him in a private, comfortable setting. Be direct and sincere. Explain your reasons for not being forthcoming initially, but emphasize that you value the relationship and want to move forward with honesty and openness. Prepare for a range of reactions and be understanding if he needs time to process this information. If the relationship has potential, he may appreciate your candor and be willing to work through the complexities. If not, it's better to know now rather than continue building on a foundation that isn't solid. Remember, trust once broken is hard to rebuild, so be prepared for the possibility that this might be a deal-breaker for him.

### Question:
how do you respond if you're dating a much older man and someone asks if he is your father? -- the younger woman in vero beach, fla.
### Answer:
Respond with poise and clarity. You could simply say, "He's actually my partner," and steer the conversation in a direction you're comfortable with.

### Question:
is there such a thing as "real love"? you know, the kind where you never feel complete unless your partner is there? i read books about this kind of love. i see movies about it and hear songs, but i have never experienced it. i am not a teen-ager, abby. i am 47 years old and wonder if i have missed out. -- wondering in iowa
### Answer:
Real love does exist, but it's not always as portrayed in books, movies, or songs, which often romanticize and dramatize emotions. Real love is about a deep connection, mutual respect, and a commitment to support each other. It's normal to feel complete on your own and still have a fulfilling relationship. You haven't missed out; love can happen at any age, and it's more about finding someone compatible than fitting a narrative. Focus on building a strong foundation of communication and shared values, and be open to the different forms love can take.

### Question:
i am a divorced woman with one child, and i'm in a relationship with a younger man. he has his own home, and i have mine. he stays at my house three nights a week and every other weekend, when my child is not with me. he eats and grooms himself in my home and swims in the community pool. he never offers to pay for anything, like food, movie tickets, etc. if we go out, he expects me to pay my own way. in today's world is there any responsibility on a man in a relationship to pay for anything other than himself? are the days of men taking women out and paying for the date gone? shouldn't he offer to bring groceries during the times he spends at my home? what should a lady expect from a man in a dating relationship? -- gal in virginia
### Answer:
In today's world, the expectations around who pays for what in a relationship are much more flexible and should be based on mutual agreement rather than traditional gender roles. It's important to communicate openly about financial expectations and contributions. If you feel that your partner should contribute to groceries or other expenses, it's reasonable to bring this up in a conversation.

A healthy relationship involves a fair distribution of expenses that both parties agree upon. It's not about what a lady should expect from a man, but rather what both partners expect from each other in terms of support, whether financial or otherwise. Discuss your feelings and preferences with him, and work together to find a balance that feels right for both of you. Remember, it's about mutual respect and understanding each other's needs and capabilities.
