### Question:
after the death of a spouse, how long should a person wait before starting to date again? -- dottie in michigan
### Answer:
There is no specific time frame that applies to everyone, as grief and healing are unique for each individual. Some people may feel ready to start dating again shortly after their spouse's death, while others may need more time to grieve and process their loss. It's important for a person to take the time they need and not rush into a new relationship before they feel emotionally prepared. When someone is ready to date again, it's often a sign that they have found a balance between honoring their past relationship and looking forward to the future with hope and optimism.

### Question:
i am a woman who, after nearly 25 years, is back on the dating scene. those years were spent in a same-sex relationship. i just happened to fall in love with a woman. i have custody of our child from the union. i do not put a label on my sexual orientation. i would like to meet a nice man and pursue a new relationship. how do i let interested parties know about my past? being back in the dating world is difficult enough without having to explain an unusual history. -- back in the game in arizona
### Answer:
Embrace your past as part of what makes you unique and don't feel the need to apologize or over-explain it. When you meet someone new, share information about yourself gradually and naturally. If and when it feels right, you can discuss your previous relationship and parenting experience. Focus on being open and honest while also respecting your own boundaries. Remember, the right person will accept you for who you are today.

### Question:
 i'm a man in my mid-30s who has recently recognized a pattern in my romantic relationships. a few of them lasted for several years, before they ended for various reasons. in between, i've gone a couple of years before seeking out and starting a new relationship. in the in-between time, i go online and meet people i have no intention of meeting in "real life," but who provide conversation and intimacy while i enjoy single life. i'm about to repeat the pattern again. i'm a few months out of a three-year relationship and have met someone online. it's great to chat online and over the phone, but we are not close geographically, and i have no intention of meeting in person. what's your insight on this, and do you think this is healthy for me? any ideas you can offer regarding this pattern? -- new relationships
### Answer:
It sounds like you're seeking a balance between enjoying the single life and connecting with others. While it's completely normal to have casual online interactions, it's important to be mindful of your intentions and how they align with your long-term goals. If you find yourself repeating this pattern, it might be worth reflecting on what each new relationship brings to your life and whether there are any underlying reasons why you prefer to keep things virtual rather than pursuing in-person connections. Consider exploring ways to integrate more meaningful interactions into your single life, such as joining local groups or activities where you can meet people with shared interests. This can help you build a fulfilling social life while still enjoying the freedom of being single.

### Question:
i'm 20 years old and have never dated anyone. i have a lot of friends and do well in school and at work, and i try to be a good, kind, friendly person. what can i do to make myself datable? am i missing some crucial step in how to become a girlfriend? -- old maid in st. louis
### Answer:
You're already on the right track by being a well-rounded individual with friends and success in school and work. To make yourself more datable, focus on building your confidence, being proactive about meeting new people, and expressing your interest in potential partners. Remember that everyone has their own timeline for dating, so don't pressure yourself to rush into a relationship. Be patient and enjoy the process of getting to know others.

### Question:
it seems i will never meet my "mr. right." every person i'm attracted to is either in a relationship or doesn't like me. my questions are: (a) when is it ok to just "settle"? and (b) do you have to be attracted to your mr. right, and/or can you take the risk that the "supposed" sparkle/love will come in time? -- tired of dating, landover, md.
### Answer:
(a) Settling should never be the goal in a relationship. It's important to maintain standards and not compromise on values or what you truly desire in a partner. However, it's also crucial to be realistic and understand that no one is perfect. Sometimes, people may have to work on certain aspects of their relationship to make it thrive.

(b) Attraction is an essential component of any relationship, but it's not the only factor. It's possible for feelings of attraction to develop over time as you get to know someone and appreciate their qualities. However, it's important to be honest with yourself about your feelings and not force a relationship that doesn't feel right.

Remember, love takes time, and sometimes it's a matter of being patient and allowing relationships to grow naturally. It's also crucial to keep an open mind and heart while dating, but never settle for less than you deserve.

### Question:
my boyfriend, "clay," and i recently met another couple, "doreen" and "bob," who let us know they're interested in socializing together. i like the concept of double-dating. it has a different social dynamic than hanging out with clay's or my single friends. at first we enjoyed our time with them. we met twice for dinner that first month. however, lately we've been feeling pressured. doreen sends four or five e-mails during the week and then a few text messages asking about our plans and if we want to meet them on saturday. i have tried to explain that we can't afford to go out every weekend and that clay and i sometimes have other plans. i have told them i'd be willing to host a game night or rent a movie, but i get the impression they consider it an insult. the issue here is that we don't like being pushed. one text or e-mail toward the end of the week is plenty for us. but receiving several inquiries all week makes us feel trapped. we have our own projects, friends and activities. we can't spend every weekend with this couple. as much as we enjoy spending time with them, how can we politely let them know that it is becoming too much? -- in demand in annapolis
### Answer:
To maintain your independence while still enjoying their company, you might want to set clear boundaries and communicate your needs effectively. Here are a few suggestions:

1. **Be Direct but Polite**: Let Doreen and Bob know that you appreciate their enthusiasm but find the constant communication overwhelming. Explain that you prefer less frequent check-ins and that you value your alone time with Clay.

2. **Set Boundaries**: Communicate your availability clearly. If you're okay with seeing them once a month, say so. This will help manage their expectations and give you both the space you need.

3. **Suggest Alternatives**: Offer alternative ways to stay in touch that might be less demanding for you, such as agreeing on one day a week for checking in or planning ahead for specific events rather than responding to constant inquiries.

4. **Be Consistent**: Stick to your boundaries once they're established. This will help Doreen and Bob understand that you mean what you say and respect your time and space.

5. **Reinforce Positive Interactions**: Make sure to continue enjoying the times you do spend together, so it remains a positive experience for all involved.

Remember, it's important to prioritize your own needs and not feel guilty about setting boundaries that allow you to maintain a healthy balance in your social life.

### Question:
i am newly single after a 30-year marriage. would you please explain to me the protocol regarding intimacy? after how many dates is it appropriate to engage in intimacy? and afterward, should the man call the woman or the woman call the man? how long should one wait before calling? i'm afraid if i call too soon i'll appear needy, and if i wait too long to call i'll appear to be a player. -- tentative tom in tampa
### Answer:
Congratulations on your newfound singleness! It's an exciting time to explore the dating world again after being in a long-term relationship. Regarding intimacy, there is no set rulebook for when it's appropriate to engage in physical acts with someone you're dating. It's different for everyone and depends on personal comfort levels, values, and the pace at which both partners feel ready.

Communication is key. Have an open and honest conversation with your date about what you're both looking for and how you want to proceed. If you're both on the same page, things will naturally progress as they should.

As for post-date communication, it's always a good idea for the person who initiated the date to follow up. However, in this day and age, both parties are often comfortable with either person reaching out. It's not about waiting a certain amount of time; it's more about showing genuine interest and continuing the connection.

Remember, there is no one-size-fits-all approach to dating. Trust your instincts and be mindful of your own boundaries while respecting those of others. Enjoy this new chapter in your life!

### Question:
is there such a thing as "real love"? you know, the kind where you never feel complete unless your partner is there? i read books about this kind of love. i see movies about it and hear songs, but i have never experienced it. i am not a teen-ager, abby. i am 47 years old and wonder if i have missed out. -- wondering in iowa

Yes, "real love" exists, and it's the kind that you describe—the deep, all-consuming love where you feel incomplete without your partner. It's a powerful force that can change your life and make you believe in the magic of connection. While it may seem like something only found in books or movies, many people experience this type of love throughout their lives. It's never too late to find it for yourself. Don't let age discourage you from believing in the possibility of a profound, fulfilling relationship. Keep an open heart and mind, and remember that love can come knocking at any stage of life.

### Question:
i am a divorced woman with one child, and i'm in a relationship with a younger man. he has his own home, and i have mine. he stays at my house three nights a week and every other weekend, when my child is not with me. he eats and grooms himself in my home and swims in the community pool. he never offers to pay for anything, like food, movie tickets, etc. if we go out, he expects me to pay my own way. in today's world is there any responsibility on a man in a relationship to pay for anything other than himself? are the days of men taking women out and paying for the date gone? shouldn't he offer to bring groceries during the times he spends at my home? what should a lady expect from a man in a dating relationship? -- gal in virginia
### Answer:
In today's world, gender roles are evolving, and traditional expectations about who should pay for dates or expenses within a relationship are changing. While it is not uncommon for women to expect men to take the lead financially, especially in the early stages of a relationship, it is important to remember that communication and understanding between partners are key.

If you feel that your partner should contribute more financially or at least offer to pay his share, it's important to discuss this openly with him. It's possible that he has different expectations or simply doesn't realize how his actions affect you. Explain your concerns and feelings about the situation, and listen to his perspective as well.

A healthy relationship is built on mutual respect and understanding. Both partners should feel comfortable discussing their needs and desires. If after communication there is still a discrepancy in expectations, it may be necessary to reevaluate whether this relationship aligns with what you want and need in a partner.
