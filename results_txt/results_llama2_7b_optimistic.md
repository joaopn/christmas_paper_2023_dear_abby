### Question:
after the death of a spouse, how long should a person wait before starting to date again? -- dottie in michigan
### Answer:
  Ah, Dottie in Michigan! *adjusts sunglasses* Well, my dear, I believe that the amount of time one should wait before starting to date again depends on various factors.
Firstly, it's essential to acknowledge that grieving is a personal and unique process. Everyone handles loss differently, and there's no set timeline for when someone should start dating again. It's crucial to focus on healing and taking care of oneself during this time.
That being said, I would recommend waiting at least 6-12 months after the death of a spouse before seriously considering dating. This allows for sufficient time to process emotions, reflect on the relationship, and gain clarity on what one wants in a new partner. It's important to be emotionally ready for a new relationship, rather than rushing into something that could potentially lead to more heartache.
Remember, Dottie, love is worth waiting for! Take your time, focus on self-care, and when you feel ready, the right person will come along. *winks*

### Question:
i am a woman who, after nearly 25 years, is back on the dating scene. those years were spent in a same-sex relationship. i just happened to fall in love with a woman. i have custody of our child from the union. i do not put a label on my sexual orientation. i would like to meet a nice man and pursue a new relationship. how do i let interested parties know about my past? being back in the dating world is difficult enough without having to explain an unusual history. -- back in the game in arizona
### Answer:
  As a dating advice expert, I completely understand your concerns about sharing your unique history with potential suitors. It's important to be honest and upfront about your past, but also to do so in a way that feels comfortable and safe for you.
Here are some tips on how to approach this:
1. Be direct and honest: When you're getting to know someone, it's okay to be straightforward and let them know about your past. You can say something like, "I want to be upfront with you - I've been in a same-sex relationship before, and I have custody of our child. I don't label myself, but I'm open to exploring a new relationship with someone special."
2. Use humor: If you feel comfortable doing so, you can use a little bit of humor to address the situation. For example, you could say something like, "I know this might be a surprise, but I've been practicing my 'coming out' speech for years - just kidding! (Or am I? üòâ)"
3. Focus on the present: While it's important to be honest about your past, try to focus more on the present and what you're looking for in a new relationship. You could say something like, "I'm excited to start dating again and see where things go. I'm open to meeting someone special, and I hope we can connect over shared interests and values."
4. Be prepared for reactions: Unfortunately, not everyone will be accepting or understanding of your unique situation. Be prepared for some people to react with surprise or even judgment. Remember that you deserve someone who is respectful and supportive, and don't settle for anything less.
5. Take things slow: Finally, remember to take things slow and get to know someone before sharing too much personal information. It's okay to be cautious and take things at your own pace - especially when it comes to something as personal as your past.

Remember, you don't have to hide who you are or your past ‚Äì embrace it and be proud of it! You deserve someone who loves and accepts you for who you are, and there are plenty of people out there who will appreciate your unique perspective and experiences. Good luck in your dating journey!

### Question:
 i'm a man in my mid-30s who has recently recognized a pattern in my romantic relationships. a few of them lasted for several years, before they ended for various reasons. in between, i've gone a couple of years before seeking out and starting a new relationship. in the in-between time, i go online and meet people i have no intention of meeting in "real life," but who provide conversation and intimacy while i enjoy single life. i'm about to repeat the pattern again. i'm a few months out of a three-year relationship and have met someone online. it's great to chat online and over the phone, but we are not close geographically, and i have no intention of meeting in person. what's your insight on this, and do you think this is healthy for me? any ideas you can offer regarding this pattern? -- new relationships
### Answer:
  As a dating advice expert, I understand that you're looking for companionship and intimacy outside of your recent three-year relationship. However, I must advise you that engaging in online relationships without any intention of meeting in person can be unhealthy and may lead to disappointment or even heartbreak in the long run.
Here are some insights and ideas to consider:
1. Emotional connection vs. physical intimacy: While it's great to have a deep emotional connection with someone online, it's important to remember that physical intimacy is an essential aspect of any romantic relationship. Without it, you may find yourself feeling unfulfilled or disconnected from the person you're interested in.
2. Geographical distance: Being geographically distant from your potential partner can make it challenging to build a strong and healthy relationship. It's important to consider whether the distance is temporary or permanent and how it may impact your ability to connect with each other.
3. Pattern recognition: As you've recognized, you've gone through this pattern of online relationships several times in the past. While it may provide temporary comfort and intimacy, it's essential to examine why you're repeating this pattern. Are you using online relationships as a way to avoid commitment or intimacy? Are there unresolved issues from previous relationships that are causing you to seek instant gratification? Understanding the underlying reasons for your behavior can help you break the cycle and move towards healthier relationships.
4. Self-reflection: Take some time to reflect on what you want in a relationship. What are your deal-breakers, and what are your non-negotiables? Being honest with yourself about your needs and desires can help you identify potential partners who align with your values and goals.
5. Focus on shared experiences: Instead of relying solely on online connections, try to focus on shared experiences that bring you joy and closer to the people you're interested in. This could be a hobby, a social event, or even a volunteer opportunity. By engaging in activities together, you can build a stronger connection and foundation for your relationship.

In conclusion, while I understand the appeal of online relationships, I strongly advise against relying solely on them for emotional fulfillment. It's essential to prioritize face-to-face interactions, shared experiences, and geographical proximity when building a healthy and fulfilling romantic relationship. By doing so, you can avoid the pattern of online relationships that may lead to disappointment or heartbreak in the long run.

### Question:

### Answer:
  Ah, my dear! *adjusts glasses* You're absolutely on the right track by being kind, friendly, and doing well in school and work! üòä
To make yourself even more datable, here are some additional tips:
1. Develop your passions and interests: Find things that truly excite you and make you unique. This could be anything from painting to playing an instrument to learning a new language. Share these passions with others and enjoy doing them together! üé®üé∂üìö
2. Practice self-care: Take care of your physical, mental, and emotional well-being. Exercise regularly, get enough sleep, and prioritize relaxation techniques like meditation or yoga. When you feel good about yourself, you're more likely to radiate positivity and attract potential partners! üßñ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüå±
3. Be open-minded and adventurous: Don't be afraid to step out of your comfort zone and try new things! Whether it's trying new foods, visiting new places, or taking on a new hobby, being open to new experiences can make you more interesting and attractive to others. üåÑüèûÔ∏è
4. Focus on building meaningful connections: Rather than just trying to find "the one," focus on building genuine connections with people around you. Engage in conversations, listen actively, and show empathy and kindness towards others. These qualities will help you build strong relationships that can potentially blossom into something more romantic. üí¨üë´

### Question:
it seems i will never meet my "mr. right." every person i'm attracted to is either in a relationship or doesn't like me. my questions are: (a) when is it ok to just "settle"? and (b) do you have to be attracted to your mr. right, and/or can you take the risk that the "supposed" sparkle/love will come in time? -- tired of dating, landover, md.
### Answer:
  Dear Landover,
Ah, I see! It sounds like you're feeling a bit frustrated with the dating scene and are wondering if it's time to settle for someone who may not be your ideal match. My dear, let me tell you something ‚Äì love is all about timing, chemistry, and compatibility. And trust me, it's okay to take your time and wait for that special someone who makes your heart skip a beat!
Firstly, when it comes to settling, it's important to define what "settling" means to you. Are you willing to compromise on certain qualities or values? Or are you looking for someone who checks off every box on your list? Remember, no one is perfect, and everyone has their own unique quirks and flaws. So, don't be too hard on yourself or your potential partners.
Now, let's talk about attraction. While it's important to feel that spark or connection with someone, it's not always a guarantee that it will grow over time. In fact, research shows that the "honeymoon phase" of a relationship tends to fade within the first few months. But that doesn't mean you won't develop deeper feelings for your partner as you get to know them better!
My advice is to focus on building a strong foundation of mutual respect, trust, and communication with your partner. If you find yourself feeling content, happy, and supported in the relationship, then that's all that matters! After all, love is a choice, and it's important to choose someone who makes you feel good about yourself and your life.
So, my dear, don't give up on love just yet! Keep being open-minded, kind, and genuine in your interactions with others, and the right person will come along when the time is right. And hey, who knows ‚Äì maybe that special someone is already out there, waiting for you to notice them! üòâ
Take care, and stay positive!

### Question:
my boyfriend, "clay," and i recently met another couple, "doreen" and "bob," who let us know they're interested in socializing together. i like the concept of double-dating. it has a different social dynamic than hanging out with clay's or my single friends. at first we enjoyed our time with them. we met twice for dinner that first month. however, lately we've been feeling pressured. doreen sends four or five e-mails during the week and then a few text messages asking about our plans and if we want to meet them on saturday. i have tried to explain that we can't afford to go out every weekend and that clay and i sometimes have other plans. i have told them i'd be willing to host a game night or rent a movie, but i get the impression they consider it an insult. the issue here is that we don't like being pushed. one text or e-mail toward the end of the week is plenty for us. but receiving several inquiries all week makes us feel trapped. we have our own projects, friends and activities. we can't spend every weekend with this couple. as much as we enjoy spending time with them, how can we politely let them know that it is becoming too much? -- in demand in annapolis
### Answer:
  As a dating advice expert, I understand your concern about feeling pressured by the other couple. It's important to set boundaries and communicate your needs clearly. Here are some suggestions on how to handle this situation:
1. Be direct and honest: Let Doreen and Bob know how you feel in a kind but firm manner. You can say something like, "Hey guys, I appreciate your interest in spending time together, but we need some space to focus on our own projects and friends. Could we limit our double-dating to once a month or every other week?"
2. Offer alternatives: Suggest alternative ways to spend time together that are more manageable for you, such as hosting a game night or renting a movie. This way, you can still enjoy each other's company without feeling overwhelmed.
3. Set clear expectations: Make sure you and Clay communicate your boundaries clearly with Doreen and Bob. Establish a schedule that works for everyone involved and stick to it.
4. Practice assertive communication: It's important to be assertive but not aggressive when communicating your needs. Use "I" statements to express how you feel, such as "I feel overwhelmed with the frequency of your invitations."
5. Be respectful: Remember that Doreen and Bob are also enjoying themselves, so be respectful of their feelings. Avoid being confrontational or critical, and try to find a solution that works for everyone.

By following these tips, you can politely let Doreen and Bob know that it's becoming too much without hurting their feelings. Remember, communication is key in any relationship, and setting boundaries is an important part of maintaining healthy relationships.

### Question:
i am newly single after a 30-year marriage. would you please explain to me the protocol regarding intimacy? after how many dates is it appropriate to engage in intimacy? and afterward, should the man call the woman or the woman call the man? how long should one wait before calling? i'm afraid if i call too soon i'll appear needy, and if i wait too long to call i'll appear to be a player. -- tentative tom in tampa
### Answer:
  Ah, Tentative Tom in Tampa! *adjusts sunglasses* Well, my dear fellow, I must say you've come to the right place for some expert advice on this matter of intimacy and dating etiquette. *winks*
Firstly, let me assure you that there is no one-size-fits-all answer to your questions, as every individual and relationship is unique. However, I can offer some general guidelines to help you navigate this exciting new chapter in your life. *smiles*
1. Intimacy: It's important to remember that intimacy should be a mutual and consensual decision between both parties. There's no hard and fast rule on when it's appropriate to engage in intimacy, but I would suggest waiting until you feel a strong emotional connection with your partner. This could be after a few dates or whenever you both feel comfortable and ready.
2. Calling: Ah, the age-old question of who should call first! *chuckles* My dear Tom, it's important to remember that communication is key in any relationship. If you're interested in seeing your partner again, don't be afraid to make the first move and call them after a date or two. However, if you're unsure about their feelings, it's okay to wait for them to make the first move. *winks*
3. Timing: As for how long to wait before calling, it really depends on the situation. If you've had a great time with your partner and want to see them again soon, don't be afraid to call within a day or two of the date. However, if you're unsure about their feelings or they seem busy, it's okay to give them some space and wait for them to reach out.
Remember, Tom, the most important thing is to communicate openly and honestly with your partner and prioritize mutual respect and consent in any physical or romantic encounter. *smiles*
I hope these tips help you navigate this exciting new chapter in your life! Remember to always be yourself, be open-minded, and above all, have fun! *winks*

### Question:
i do online dating. for safety, i use an alias. i look much younger than my 43 years, so i went out with a 29-year-old who thinks i'm 33. i have horrible luck with relationships and didn't think this one would be any different. boy, was i wrong! we have been dating three weeks now. how do i tell him i'm 43, have two kids he doesn't know about and a different name? or should i just break it off now? -- incognito in mississippi
### Answer:
  Oh my goodness, Incognito in Mississippi! *giggles* I can't believe you've been dating this guy for three whole weeks without telling him the truth about your age and identity! *winks*
Listen, hon, I understand that you might be feeling a bit nervous about revealing your true self to this guy, but trust me, honesty is always the best policy when it comes to matters of the heart. It's better to be upfront and honest from the beginning rather than hiding behind a lie and risking hurting him or yourself in the long run.
So, my advice would be to sit down with him and have a heart-to-heart conversation about your true identity and age. Be honest, be open, and be prepared for any outcome. Remember, love is all about acceptance and mutual respect, and if he can't accept you for who you are, then he's not the right guy for you.
And hey, who knows? Maybe he'll surprise you and be super cool with it! *winks* Either way, hon, just be true to yourself and follow your heart. That's what I always say! üòâ

  Ah, my dear friend! *adjusts glasses* Attracting single women on a budget, you say? Well, let me tell you, it's all about being creative and resourceful! üòâ

The key is to be thoughtful and considerate of her preferences while keeping costs low. üíï
Lastly, remember that building a connection takes time and effort. Be patient, kind, and genuine in your approach. Show her that you're interested in getting to know her as a person, not just as a potential romantic partner. *smiles*

### Answer:
  Ah, I see! *chuckles* Well, my dear, I must say that age is just a number, and it doesn't define the love we share. *winks* Your father...I mean, your partner, is a wonderful person, and he brings so much joy and wisdom to our lives. *smiles*

You just have to be open to receiving it. *nods* Now, I know what you might be thinking: "Abby, how can I possibly find love when I've never experienced it?"

### Question:
i am a divorced woman with one child, and i'm in a relationship with a younger man. he has his own home, and i have mine. he stays at my house three nights a week and every other weekend, when my child is not with me. he eats and grooms himself in my home and swims in the community pool. he never offers to pay for anything, like food, movie tickets, etc. if we go out, he expects me to pay my own way. in today's world is there any responsibility on a man in a relationship to pay for anything other than himself? are the days of men taking women out and paying for the date gone? shouldn't he offer to bring groceries during the times he spends at my home? what should a lady expect from a man in a dating relationship? -- gal in virginia
### Answer:
  As a dating advice expert, I believe that mutual respect and equality are essential in any healthy relationship. While it's understandable that your partner may not always offer to pay for everything, it's important to communicate your expectations and boundaries.
In today's society, it's no longer expected or assumed that a man will always pay for everything in a relationship. However, it's still important to have open and honest communication about who is contributing financially and how. It's possible to find a balance that works for both partners, such as taking turns paying for shared expenses or finding other ways to split costs.
It's also important to remember that dating is not just about financial contributions. Men can show their appreciation and care for their partners in many ways beyond money, such as helping with household chores, supporting each other's goals and dreams, and being present and engaged in shared activities.
In your situation, it may be helpful to have a conversation with your partner about your expectations around financial contributions. You could explain that while you understand he may not always want to pay for everything, you would appreciate it if he offered to bring groceries or other essentials during the times he spends at your home. By communicating openly and honestly, you can find a solution that works for both of you.
Ultimately, a healthy relationship is built on mutual respect, trust, and communication. While financial contributions are an important aspect of any relationship, they should not be the only factor considered when evaluating a partner's commitment or responsibility. By focusing on shared experiences, joy, and mutual support, you can build a strong and fulfilling connection with your partner.
