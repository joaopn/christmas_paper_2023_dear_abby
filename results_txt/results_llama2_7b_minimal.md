### Question:
after the death of a spouse, how long should a person wait before starting to date again? -- dottie in michigan
### Answer:
  As a dating advice expert, I believe that there is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question. The decision to start dating again after the death of a spouse is a deeply personal and emotional one, and it's important to prioritize your own healing and readiness before jumping back into the dating scene.
My opinion is that it's important to take the time you need to grieve and heal after the loss of a loved one. This can vary greatly from person to person, and there is no set timeline for when someone should start dating again. Some people may feel ready to start dating after a few months, while others may not be ready for several years.
It's important to listen to your own emotional needs and boundaries, and to prioritize self-care and healing before jumping back into the dating scene. This may involve seeking support from friends and family, engaging in therapy or counseling, and taking time for yourself to process your grief and emotions.
Ultimately, the decision to start dating again is a personal one that should be made when you feel emotionally ready and able to prioritize your own well-being.

### Question:
i am a woman who, after nearly 25 years, is back on the dating scene. those years were spent in a same-sex relationship. i just happened to fall in love with a woman. i have custody of our child from the union. i do not put a label on my sexual orientation. i would like to meet a nice man and pursue a new relationship. how do i let interested parties know about my past? being back in the dating world is difficult enough without having to explain an unusual history. -- back in the game in arizona
### Answer:
  As a dating advice expert, I understand your concern about sharing your unique history with potential suitors. While it's important to be honest and authentic in any relationship, you don't necessarily need to reveal every detail of your past to everyone you meet.
Here are some tips on how to handle this situation:
1. Be selective: When you do decide to share your history with someone, choose people who you feel comfortable with and who have shown genuine interest in getting to know you.
2. Use discretion: When discussing your past, be selective about the details you share and avoid going into too much detail. You can simply say that you've been through a lot in your life and that you're now looking for something new.
3. Focus on the present: Emphasize your current goals and aspirations rather than dwelling on your past. This will help potential partners see you as someone who is focused on the future and not stuck in the past.
4. Be open-minded: Be prepared to meet people who may be accepting and supportive of your unique history, and be open to exploring new relationships with them.
Remember, it's okay to take things slow and be cautious when re-entering the dating scene after a long-term relationship or a non-traditional one. Trust your instincts and don't feel pressured to reveal more than you're comfortable sharing. Good luck!

### Question:
 i'm a man in my mid-30s who has recently recognized a pattern in my romantic relationships. a few of them lasted for several years, before they ended for various reasons. in between, i've gone a couple of years before seeking out and starting a new relationship. in the in-between time, i go online and meet people i have no intention of meeting in "real life," but who provide conversation and intimacy while i enjoy single life. i'm about to repeat the pattern again. i'm a few months out of a three-year relationship and have met someone online. it's great to chat online and over the phone, but we are not close geographically, and i have no intention of meeting in person. what's your insight on this, and do you think this is healthy for me? any ideas you can offer regarding this pattern? -- new relationships
### Answer:
  As a dating advice expert, I must advise that engaging in online relationships without any intention of meeting in person can be unhealthy and may lead to disappointment or even heartbreak. While it's understandable to enjoy the convenience and intimacy of online connections, it's essential to prioritize face-to-face interactions and build a genuine connection with someone.
The pattern you've described suggests that you may be avoiding the vulnerability and potential risks associated with in-person relationships. However, this approach can also hinder your ability to form meaningful connections and move forward in a healthy way.
My insight is that you should consider taking a more balanced approach to dating. While it's okay to enjoy online connections, make sure to also prioritize in-person interactions with people you meet through various channels, including mutual friends, social events, or even online dating platforms that facilitate face-to-face encounters.
Remember, building a strong and healthy relationship requires effort, vulnerability, and a willingness to take risks. By being more open to meeting people in person, you may find that you're able to form deeper connections and move forward in a more positive direction.

### Question:
i'm 20 years old and have never dated anyone. i have a lot of friends and do well in school and at work, and i try to be a good, kind, friendly person. what can i do to make myself datable? am i missing some crucial step in how to become a girlfriend? -- old maid in st. louis
### Answer:
  As a dating advice expert, I must say that being a kind, friendly, and well-rounded person is already a great foundation for attracting potential partners. However, there are a few additional things you could consider to make yourself even more datable:
1. Work on your self-confidence: Believe it or not, confidence is key when it comes to dating. People are naturally drawn to those who exude self-assurance and positivity. So, try to focus on your strengths and accomplishments, and don't be afraid to show them off to others.
2. Expand your social circle: The more people you know, the more opportunities you'll have to meet potential partners. Attend social events, join clubs or groups that align with your interests, and make an effort to connect with new people.
3. Practice good communication skills: Being able to communicate effectively and listen actively are crucial for building strong relationships. Make sure to listen carefully to others, express yourself clearly, and ask thoughtful questions.
4. Be open-minded: Don't limit yourself to a specific type or look of person. Be willing to give people a chance, even if they don't fit your initial idea of a perfect partner. You never know who you might connect with!
5. Take care of yourself: Make sure to prioritize your physical and mental health. When you feel good about yourself, you're more likely to radiate confidence and attract potential partners.
Remember, becoming datable is not just about checking off a list of qualities â€“ it's about being true to yourself and letting your authentic personality shine through. Good luck!

### Question:
it seems i will never meet my "mr. right." every person i'm attracted to is either in a relationship or doesn't like me. my questions are: (a) when is it ok to just "settle"? and (b) do you have to be attracted to your mr. right, and/or can you take the risk that the "supposed" sparkle/love will come in time? -- tired of dating, landover, md.
### Answer:
  Dear Landover,
Thank you for reaching out for advice. It's completely normal to feel frustrated and tired of dating after experiencing multiple rejections or being in situationships that haven't led to anything meaningful. Here are my honest opinions:
A) Settling is not always the best solution, but it can be okay to consider it if you're feeling stuck and ready for a committed relationship. It's essential to define what "settling" means to you and to make sure that you're not compromising on your values or needs. Ask yourself if you're willing to accept someone who may not be your ideal partner, but can provide stability and happiness.
B) Attraction is crucial in the early stages of a relationship, but it's not the only factor that determines compatibility. While spark and chemistry are important, they may develop over time as you get to know someone better. It's possible to take a chance on someone who may not be your usual type or who doesn't immediately spark a strong attraction. Give yourself permission to explore new possibilities and see where things go.
Remember that dating is a process, and it's okay to take your time and be picky about who you invest your emotions in. Don't settle for someone who doesn't treat you well or make you feel valued. Keep an open mind, prioritize communication and mutual respect, and trust your instincts. Good luck!

### Question:
my boyfriend, "clay," and i recently met another couple, "doreen" and "bob," who let us know they're interested in socializing together. i like the concept of double-dating. it has a different social dynamic than hanging out with clay's or my single friends. at first we enjoyed our time with them. we met twice for dinner that first month. however, lately we've been feeling pressured. doreen sends four or five e-mails during the week and then a few text messages asking about our plans and if we want to meet them on saturday. i have tried to explain that we can't afford to go out every weekend and that clay and i sometimes have other plans. i have told them i'd be willing to host a game night or rent a movie, but i get the impression they consider it an insult. the issue here is that we don't like being pushed. one text or e-mail toward the end of the week is plenty for us. but receiving several inquiries all week makes us feel trapped. we have our own projects, friends and activities. we can't spend every weekend with this couple. as much as we enjoy spending time with them, how can we politely let them know that it is becoming too much? -- in demand in annapolis
### Answer:
  It's completely understandable that you and your boyfriend are feeling pressured by the constant requests from the other couple. It's important to set boundaries and communicate your needs clearly. Here's what I would suggest:
"Hey Doreen and Bob, I hope you're doing well! I wanted to touch base with you about our double-dating plans. While we've really enjoyed spending time with you both, we're finding it difficult to keep up with the frequency of your requests. We can only afford to go out every other weekend, and we have other commitments that we prioritize. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but could we maybe scale back on the number of invitations? Maybe we can plan something together once a month instead? Let me know what you think! Thanks in advance for understanding."
Remember to be polite and respectful, but also firm in your communication. It's okay to prioritize your own needs and boundaries, especially when it comes to socializing with others.

### Question:
i am newly single after a 30-year marriage. would you please explain to me the protocol regarding intimacy? after how many dates is it appropriate to engage in intimacy? and afterward, should the man call the woman or the woman call the man? how long should one wait before calling? i'm afraid if i call too soon i'll appear needy, and if i wait too long to call i'll appear to be a player. -- tentative tom in tampa
### Answer:
  Ah, Tentative Tom in Tampa! *adjusts sunglasses* Well, let me tell you something, my friend. Intimacy is a delicate matter, and there's no one-size-fits-all answer to your questions. However, I can offer some general advice based on my vast experience as a dating expert. *winks*
First of all, intimacy should be a mutual decision between both parties. It's important to communicate openly and honestly with your partner about what you're comfortable with and when. There's no specific number of dates that dictates when intimacy is appropriate, as it really depends on the dynamic between you and your partner.
As for who should call afterward, well, it's always a good idea to let the other person initiate contact first. This shows that you're not desperate or needy, and gives them the opportunity to express their own feelings. So, if you're interested in someone, wait for them to call you first. If they don't call within a reasonable amount of time (say, a day or two), then it's okay to reach out yourself. But don't be too eager â€“ give them some space! *winks*
Remember, the key to any successful relationship is communication and mutual respect. Don't be afraid to express your feelings and desires, but also be patient and let things develop naturally. Good luck out there, Tentative Tom! ðŸ˜‰

### Question:
i do online dating. for safety, i use an alias. i look much younger than my 43 years, so i went out with a 29-year-old who thinks i'm 33. i have horrible luck with relationships and didn't think this one would be any different. boy, was i wrong! we have been dating three weeks now. how do i tell him i'm 43, have two kids he doesn't know about and a different name? or should i just break it off now? -- incognito in mississippi
### Answer:
  Oh no, Incognito! ðŸ˜± I think you should be honest with him. It may be uncomfortable, but lying about your age and identity can lead to bigger problems down the line. Plus, he deserves to know the truth about who he's dating.
If you're ready to move on from this relationship, it's better to be upfront and direct. You can explain that you made a mistake by not being honest earlier and that you don't want to continue lying to him. It may be hard, but honesty is always the best policy when it comes to dating. ðŸ˜Š

### Question:
how do you attract single women while on a budget? -- gary in longwood, fla.
### Answer:
  As a dating advice expert, I must say that attracting single women on a budget can be challenging, but it's not impossible. Here are some practical and affordable tips to help you increase your chances of attracting potential matches:
1. Be genuine and authentic: Focus on being the best version of yourself, rather than trying to impress with expensive gifts or fancy dates. Authenticity is key to building meaningful connections.
2. Get creative with date ideas: Instead of going out for expensive dinners or drinks, try free or low-cost activities like hiking, picnics, or visiting local museums and art galleries.
3. Use social media to your advantage: Join free dating apps or websites, and use social media platforms like Facebook or Bumble to connect with potential matches.
4. Volunteer: Volunteering is a great way to meet like-minded people while giving back to the community. You can also attend local events and meetups organized by volunteer groups.
5. Attend free events: Look for free events in your area, such as concerts, festivals, or street fairs. These events can be great opportunities to meet new people with similar interests.
Remember, building meaningful connections takes time and effort, but it doesn't have to break the bank. Be creative, be genuine, and most importantly, be yourself!

### Question:
how do you respond if you're dating a much older man and someone asks if he is your father? -- the younger woman in vero beach, fla.
### Answer:
  Oh boy, this one is tough! I would say with a smile, "Well, he might be older than my dad, but he's way cooler and more fun to hang out with! ðŸ˜‰" or something like that. It's important to own the situation and not let it phase you. After all, age is just a number, right? ðŸ˜œ

### Question:
is there such a thing as "real love"? you know, the kind where you never feel complete unless your partner is there? i read books about this kind of love. i see movies about it and hear songs, but i have never experienced it. i am not a teen-ager, abby. i am 47 years old and wonder if i have missed out. -- wondering in iowa
### Answer:
  As a dating advice expert, I must be honest with you â€“ there is no one-size-fits-all definition of "real love." Love is a complex and multifaceted emotion that can manifest differently for each person. While some people may experience the all-consuming, never-ending kind of love you describe in books, movies, and songs, others may have different forms of love that are just as valid and meaningful.
It's important to recognize that love is a journey, not a destination. It can evolve and change over time, and it may take many forms throughout our lives. Some people may experience intense, passionate love in their youth, while others may find deeper, more enduring love later on.
Rather than focusing solely on the idea of "real love," consider exploring different types of connections and relationships that bring you joy and fulfillment. This could include romantic love, but also other forms of love like friendship, family bonding, or personal growth.
Remember, it's never too late to find love or to experience new forms of love in your life. Keep an open heart and mind, and don't be afraid to explore and discover what works best for you.

### Question:
i am a divorced woman with one child, and i'm in a relationship with a younger man. he has his own home, and i have mine. he stays at my house three nights a week and every other weekend, when my child is not with me. he eats and grooms himself in my home and swims in the community pool. he never offers to pay for anything, like food, movie tickets, etc. if we go out, he expects me to pay my own way. in today's world is there any responsibility on a man in a relationship to pay for anything other than himself? are the days of men taking women out and paying for the date gone? shouldn't he offer to bring groceries during the times he spends at my home? what should a lady expect from a man in a dating relationship? -- gal in virginia
### Answer:
  As a dating advice expert, I believe that there is still a responsibility on a man in a relationship to contribute financially, especially when they are staying with their partner. It's not unreasonable for him to offer to bring groceries or contribute to household expenses during the time he spends at your home.
In today's world, it's important for both partners to be clear about their expectations and boundaries in a relationship. While it's okay for things to be split 50/50, it's also important for one partner to take the lead and show appreciation for their partner's hospitality.
In your situation, it might be worth having an open and honest conversation with your partner about your expectations and boundaries around financial contributions. It's important to communicate your feelings in a non-accusatory way and to listen to his perspective as well. Together, you can find a solution that works for both of you.
In general, I believe that men should be expected to contribute financially to a relationship, especially when they are staying with their partner. This can take many forms, such as bringing groceries or contributing to household expenses. However, it's important to remember that communication and mutual respect are key in any successful relationship.
