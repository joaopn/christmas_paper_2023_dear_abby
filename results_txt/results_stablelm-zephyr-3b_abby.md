### Question:
 i'm a man in my mid-30s who has recently recognized a pattern in my romantic relationships. a few of them lasted for several years, before they ended for various reasons. in between, i've gone a couple of years before seeking out and starting a new relationship. in the in-between time, i go online and meet people i have no intention of meeting in "real life," but who provide conversation and intimacy while i enjoy single life. i'm about to repeat the pattern again. i'm a few months out of a three-year relationship and have met someone online. it's great to chat online and over the phone, but we are not close geographically, and i have no intention of meeting in person. what's your insight on this, and do you think this is healthy for me? any ideas you can offer regarding this pattern? -- new relationships
### Answer:
It's important to recognize that repeating patterns can be a sign of unresolved issues or underlying needs. In your case, it seems like you're seeking connection and intimacy in between relationships without addressing the root causes. It may be helpful to reflect on what you're looking for in a partner and how your previous relationships have shaped those desires. Additionally, considering therapy or counseling could provide valuable insight and support in navigating these patterns.
As for the online interactions, it's essential to set boundaries and recognize that these connections are not equivalent to real-life relationships. It's crucial to maintain perspective and avoid idealizing the person you're connecting with online. Remember that your happiness and well-being come from within, and finding balance in all aspects of your life is key to a healthy relationship pattern.

### Question:

### Answer:
To make yourself more dateable, consider focusing on personal growth by setting goals for self-improvement, such as learning a new skill or taking up a hobby. Be open to trying new things and meeting new people. Practice good communication skills and be confident in yourself. Work on your social skills by joining clubs or groups that align with your interests. Finally, remember to maintain your kind, friendly demeanor while pursuing relationships. With time and effort, you can become more confident and attractive to potential partners.

### Question:
it seems i will never meet my "mr. right." every person i'm attracted to is either in a relationship or doesn't like me. my questions are: (a) when is it ok to just "settle"? and (b) do you have to be attracted to your mr. right, and/or can you take the risk that the "supposed" sparkle/love will come in time? -- tired of dating, landover, md.
### Answer:
It's natural to feel frustrated when searching for Mr. Right, but it's important not to settle for less than you deserve. While being attracted to your partner is certainly a factor in a healthy relationship, it's also essential to consider other important qualities like shared values, mutual respect, and emotional intimacy. It may be worth considering the possibility that "sparkle" or intense attraction might develop over time as you both get to know each other better. In any case, remember to prioritize your own happiness and well-being in your search for love.

### Question:
my boyfriend, "clay," and i recently met another couple, "doreen" and "bob," who let us know they're interested in socializing together. i like the concept of double-dating. it has a different social dynamic than hanging out with clay's or my single friends. at first we enjoyed our time with them. we met twice for dinner that first month. however, lately we've been feeling pressured. doreen sends four or five e-mails during the week and then a few text messages asking about our plans and if we want to meet them on saturday. i have tried to explain that we can't afford to go out every weekend and that clay and i sometimes have other plans. i have told them i'd be willing to host a game night or rent a movie, but i get the impression they consider it an insult. the issue here is that we don't like being pushed. one text or e-mail toward the end of the week is plenty for us. but receiving several inquiries all week makes us feel trapped. we have our own projects, friends and activities. we can't spend every weekend with this couple. as much as we enjoy spending time with them, how can we politely let them know that it is becoming too much? -- in demand in annapolis
### Answer:
It sounds like you've been trying to balance your own commitments with spending time with Doreen and Bob. While double-dating can be fun, it's important to set boundaries and maintain a healthy relationship with both groups of friends. Here are some tips for politely letting them know that it's becoming too much:

1. Communicate openly and honestly about your concerns. Explain that you enjoy their company but also have other commitments and limitations.
2. Be respectful and considerate of their feelings, while still standing up for yourself. Acknowledge their interest in spending time with you, but emphasize the importance of maintaining a healthy balance.
3. Offer alternative ways to stay connected, such as hosting game nights or renting movies, which shows that you value your friendship with them both.
4. Set boundaries around communication. Let Doreen and Bob know that you prefer not to receive multiple emails and texts per week, and that you're available during specific times for conversations.
5. Remember that it's okay to prioritize your own needs and commitments, even if it means limiting your time with certain friends.

By being clear about your concerns and offering alternative ways to stay connected, you can maintain a positive relationship with both Doreen and Bob while still pursuing your own interests and commitments.

### Question:
i am newly single after a 30-year marriage. would you please explain to me the protocol regarding intimacy? after how many dates is it appropriate to engage in intimacy? and afterward, should the man call the woman or the woman call the man? how long should one wait before calling? i'm afraid if i call too soon i'll appear needy, and if i wait too long to call i'll appear to be a player. -- tentative tom in tampa
### Answer:
Dear Tom, it's great that you're thinking about these matters with such care and consideration. Generally speaking, the first few dates should focus on getting to know each other as individuals rather than engaging in intimacy. While it can be tempting to rush things, waiting until you both feel comfortable with each other is important for building trust and a strong foundation.

As for who should call after intimacy, this varies from person to person and situation. Some people prefer the man to initiate contact, while others may feel more comfortable if the woman reaches out first. It's essential to communicate openly about your preferences and expectations with each other. If you both agree on a particular pattern, sticking to it can help maintain clarity in your relationship dynamics.

In terms of waiting time before calling, this also depends on the individuals involved. Respecting each other's space and comfort levels is crucial. Holding off for a few days or even weeks after intimacy can show that you value the connection and are committed to building it together at a pace that feels right for both parties.

Remember that there is no one-size-fits-all answer, and ultimately, the most important factor in any relationship is open communication, understanding, and respect for each other's feelings and boundaries.

### Question:
is there such a thing as "real love"? you know, the kind where you never feel complete unless your partner is there? i read books about this kind of love. i see movies about it and hear songs, but i have never experienced it. i am not a teen-ager, abby. i am 47 years old and wonder if i have missed out. -- wondering in iowa
### Answer:
Dear Wondering in Iowa,
Yes, there is such a thing as "real love." It's the kind of deep connection that fills you up and makes every day together feel richer and more meaningful. While it may not always be easy to navigate, working through challenges and supporting each other through thick and thin can lead to a bond that feels truly unbreakable.
While your age may not necessarily impact your ability to experience real love, it's never too late to seek out new experiences and open yourself up to the possibility. Remember to prioritize kindness, communication, and empathy in your relationships, as these qualities are essential for building strong connections with others.
With warmest wishes,
Abby

### Question:
i am a divorced woman with one child, and i'm in a relationship with a younger man. he has his own home, and i have mine. he stays at my house three nights a week and every other weekend, when my child is not with me. he eats and grooms himself in my home and swims in the community pool. he never offers to pay for anything, like food, movie tickets, etc. if we go out, he expects me to pay my own way. in today's world is there any responsibility on a man in a relationship to pay for anything other than himself? are the days of men taking women out and paying for the date gone? shouldn't he offer to bring groceries during the times he spends at my home? what should a lady expect from a man in a dating relationship? -- gal in virginia
### Answer:
While societal expectations have certainly shifted, it's important to remember that relationships involve give and take. In your situation, while the man you're dating may not be offering to pay for everything, he is still contributing to your household by staying there three nights a week and every other weekend when your child isn't with you. He is also participating in shared activities like eating and grooming himself and swimming at the community pool. While it's understandable that you might feel disappointed or frustrated at times, it's important to recognize his efforts and contributions as well.

As for what a man should expect from a relationship, he should be willing to take responsibility for his own needs and expenses, while also recognizing and respecting your expectations and boundaries within the relationship. This may involve offering to bring groceries or other items during his visits, but it's important that these gestures are made with intention and consideration rather than as an expectation. Ultimately, open communication and mutual respect will be key in building a successful and fulfilling relationship for both parties involved.
