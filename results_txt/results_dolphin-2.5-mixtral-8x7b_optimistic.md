It's essential to allow yourself time to grieve and heal before entering a new relationship.

### Answer:


Dear Back in the Game,

It's great that you're open to meeting new people and exploring different types of relationships! When it comes to sharing your past with potential partners, remember that honesty is key. You don't need to bring up your previous relationship right away, but when you feel comfortable discussing it, be straightforward and confident in your story.

Focus on the positive aspects of your past, such as the fact that you have a child from your previous relationship, which shows that you are capable of love and commitment. Emphasize how this experience has shaped who you are today and what you're looking for in a new partner.

Remember, people will appreciate your honesty and openness about your past, and it may even help you find someone who understands and accepts your unique history. Good luck on your journey back into the dating world!

### Question:
 i'm a man in my mid-30s who has recently recognized a pattern in my romantic relationships. a few of them lasted for several years, before they ended for various reasons. in between, i've gone a couple of years before seeking out and starting a new relationship. in the in-between time, i go online and meet people i have no intention of meeting in "real life," but who provide conversation and intimacy while i enjoy single life. i'm about to repeat the pattern again. i'm a few months out of a three-year relationship and have met someone online. it's great to chat online and over the phone, but we are not close geographically, and i have no intention of meeting in person. what's your insight on this, and do you think this is healthy for me? any ideas you can offer regarding this pattern? -- new relationships
### Answer:


It sounds like you've found a way to balance your desire for connection with your need for independence. As long as you're being honest about your intentions and not leading anyone on, there's nothing inherently unhealthy about maintaining online relationships while enjoying single life. It's important to remember that these connections may not always be fulfilling or sustainable in the long run, but they can provide a sense of companionship and emotional support during times when you might otherwise feel lonely.

As for your pattern of seeking out new relationships after being single for a couple of years, it's natural to crave connection and intimacy after spending time alone. It's important to be mindful of your own needs and boundaries in these situations, as well as those of the people you're meeting online. Communicating openly about your intentions and expectations can help ensure that both parties are on the same page and can lead to more fulfilling connections overall.

In terms of advice for breaking this pattern or finding a different way to approach relationships, it might be helpful to explore other ways of connecting with people outside of traditional dating apps or websites. Consider joining clubs or groups related to your interests, attending social events in your area, or reaching out to friends and acquaintances who share similar values and goals. By expanding your social circle and engaging in activities that bring you joy, you may find it easier to form meaningful connections with others without relying solely on online interactions. Ultimately, the key is to stay open-minded and maintain a positive attitude towards love and relationships, as this will help attract like-minded individuals who share your outlook on life.

### Question:
i'm 20 years old and have never dated anyone. i have a lot of friends and do well in school and at work, and i try to be a good, kind, friendly person. what can i do to make myself datable? am i missing some crucial step in how to become a girlfriend? -- old maid in st. louis
### Answer:


Dear "Old Maid,"

First of all, let me assure you that there is no such thing as an "old maid" at the age of 20! You're still very young and have plenty of time to find love. It's great that you have a strong support system with your friends and are doing well in other areas of your life. These qualities can make you more attractive to potential partners.

To become more "datable," consider focusing on self-improvement and personal growth. This could involve working on your communication skills, learning how to be more assertive, or even trying new hobbies or activities that interest you. By becoming the best version of yourself, you'll naturally become more attractive to others.

Additionally, don't be afraid to put yourself out there and take chances when it comes to meeting new people. Attend social events, join clubs or organizations related to your interests, and engage with others online through dating apps or websites. Remember that every experience is an opportunity for growth and learning, so embrace each encounter as a chance to make connections and build relationships.

Lastly, maintain a positive mindset about love and relationships. Believe in the power of connection and trust that you will find someone who appreciates your kind, friendly nature. Keep focusing on the positives in your life and remember that happiness comes from within â€“ whether or not you're currently in a relationship.

Best wishes for finding love and happiness!

### Question:
it seems i will never meet my "mr. right." every person i'm attracted to is either in a relationship or doesn't like me. my questions are: (a) when is it ok to just "settle"? and (b) do you have to be attracted to your mr. right, and/or can you take the risk that the "supposed" sparkle/love will come in time? -- tired of dating, landover, md.
### Answer:


Dear Tired of Dating,

It's completely normal to feel frustrated after a series of unsuccessful dates. However, it's important not to lose hope and give up on finding love. Remember that every relationship is unique, and sometimes it takes time to find the right person who shares your values and interests.

As for your questions:

(a) It's never ideal to settle in a relationship, as you deserve someone who truly appreciates and respects you. However, if you feel like you've been searching for a long time without any success, it might be worth considering whether your expectations are too high or unrealistic. Sometimes, finding the right person means being open-minded about what qualities you find attractive in a partner.

(b) Attraction is subjective and can develop over time as you get to know someone better. While physical attraction is important, it's also crucial to have emotional compatibility with your partner. If you feel like there could be potential for love to grow between you and someone else, don't be afraid to take a chance on them.

In conclusion, keep an open mind when it comes to dating and try not to focus solely on finding "the one." Instead, focus on building connections with people who share your values and interests, and allow yourself time to get to know them better before making any decisions about whether they could be a potential long-term partner. Good luck!

### Question:
my boyfriend, "clay," and i recently met another couple, "doreen" and "bob," who let us know they're interested in socializing together. i like the concept of double-dating. it has a different social dynamic than hanging out with clay's or my single friends. at first we enjoyed our time with them. we met twice for dinner that first month. however, lately we've been feeling pressured. doreen sends four or five e-mails during the week and then a few text messages asking about our plans and if we want to meet them on saturday. i have tried to explain that we can't afford to go out every weekend and that clay and i sometimes have other plans. i have told them i'd be willing to host a game night or rent a movie, but i get the impression they consider it an insult. the issue here is that we don't like being pushed. one text or e-mail toward the end of the week is plenty for us. but receiving several inquiries all week makes us feel trapped. we have our own projects, friends and activities. we can't spend every weekend with this couple. as much as we enjoy spending time with them, how can we politely let them know that it is becoming too much? -- in demand in annapolis
### Answer:


It sounds like you and your boyfriend are feeling overwhelmed by the constant communication and pressure from Doreen and Bob to socialize together. It's important to maintain a balance between spending time with them and pursuing your own interests and activities. Here are some suggestions for how to approach this situation:

1. Communicate openly: Sit down with Doreen and Bob and express your feelings about the current situation. Let them know that you enjoy their company but feel that the frequency of communication and socializing is becoming too much. Explain that you both have other commitments and interests, and would like to find a more comfortable pace for spending time together.

2. Set boundaries: Establish some boundaries regarding communication and socializing. For example, you could suggest that they limit their e-mails and text messages to one or two per week, and that you will respond when you have the time and interest in making plans. This way, you can maintain control over your own schedule while still keeping the lines of communication open.

3. Offer alternative suggestions: If Doreen and Bob seem offended by your suggestion of hosting a game night or renting a movie, try offering some other alternatives that might be more appealing to them. For example, you could suggest meeting for a casual picnic in the park or going on a group hike. This way, you can still spend time together without feeling like you're being pushed into doing something you don't want to do.

4. Be assertive: If Doreen and Bob continue to push for more frequent socializing despite your efforts to communicate your feelings and set boundaries, it may be necessary to be more assertive in setting limits. For example, if they ask about plans on a Saturday when you already have other commitments, simply say that you're not available that day and suggest another time or activity that works better for you.

Remember, it's important to maintain open communication with Doreen and Bob and be honest about your feelings and needs. By setting boundaries and offering alternative suggestions, you can help create a more comfortable and enjoyable social dynamic for everyone involved.

### Question:
i am newly single after a 30-year marriage. would you please explain to me the protocol regarding intimacy? after how many dates is it appropriate to engage in intimacy? and afterward, should the man call the woman or the woman call the man? how long should one wait before calling? i'm afraid if i call too soon i'll appear needy, and if i wait too long to call i'll appear to be a player. -- tentative tom in tampa
### Answer:


Dear Tentative Tom,

First of all, congratulations on your newfound single status! It can be both exciting and nerve-wracking to re-enter the dating world after such a long time. As for your questions about intimacy and communication protocols, I'm here to help you navigate these uncharted waters with ease.

When it comes to engaging in intimacy, there is no hard and fast rule regarding how many dates should pass beforehand. It ultimately depends on the comfort level and connection between both parties involved. Some couples may feel comfortable sharing intimate moments early on, while others might prefer waiting until they've gotten to know each other better. The key here is open communication â€“ discussing boundaries and preferences with your partner will ensure that everyone feels respected and heard throughout the process.

As for who should call whom after a date, again, there are no strict guidelines. Traditionally, it has been expected that the man would take the initiative in reaching out to the woman following a date. However, modern dating culture is much more flexible and encourages both parties to express interest and communicate openly. If you're unsure about when or how to reach out, consider discussing this with your partner during one of your dates. This way, you can establish mutual expectations and avoid any awkward misunderstandings down the line.

In terms of timing for calling, there is no set formula either. Some people prefer waiting a day or two before reaching out, while others might opt for contacting their date immediately afterward. Ultimately, it's important to trust your instincts and go with what feels most natural to you. Just remember that prompt communication can help keep the momentum going in your budding relationship, so don't be afraid to take the initiative if you feel compelled to do so.

In summary, Tentative Tom, when it comes to intimacy and communication protocols in dating, there are no one-size-fits-all answers. The most important thing is to prioritize open dialogue with your partner, respect each other's boundaries, and trust your instincts along the way. Good luck on your journey back into the world of dating â€“ may it be filled with joy, laughter, and many memorable experiences!

Be prepared for some initial shock or disappointment, but remember that true love can withstand many obstacles. Focus on the positive aspects of your relationship and how much you enjoy each other's company. Emphasize that despite these differences, you still feel a strong connection and want to continue building upon it together.

### Question:
i am a divorced woman with one child, and i'm in a relationship with a younger man. he has his own home, and i have mine. he stays at my house three nights a week and every other weekend, when my child is not with me. he eats and grooms himself in my home and swims in the community pool. he never offers to pay for anything, like food, movie tickets, etc. if we go out, he expects me to pay my own way. in today's world is there any responsibility on a man in a relationship to pay for anything other than himself? are the days of men taking women out and paying for the date gone? shouldn't he offer to bring groceries during the times he spends at my home? what should a lady expect from a man in a dating relationship? -- gal in virginia
### Answer:


Dear Gal,

It sounds like you have a good thing going with your younger partner. It's great that he contributes to the household by eating and grooming himself at your home, as well as spending time with you and your child. However, it is understandable that you may feel frustrated about him not offering to pay for anything or contribute more financially.

In today's world, there are no hard and fast rules about who should pay for what in a relationship. It really depends on the individuals involved and their personal preferences. Some couples prefer to split expenses equally, while others may have one person taking care of most of the financial responsibilities.

It is important to communicate openly with your partner about your expectations and feelings regarding finances. You could try having a conversation where you express how much you appreciate his presence in your life but also mention that it would be nice if he occasionally offered to contribute financially, such as by bringing groceries or paying for a meal out.

Remember, every relationship is unique, and what works for one couple may not work for another. The key is to find a balance that feels fair and comfortable for both parties involved. Good luck!
