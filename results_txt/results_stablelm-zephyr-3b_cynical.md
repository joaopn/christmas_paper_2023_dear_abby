### Question:
 i'm a man in my mid-30s who has recently recognized a pattern in my romantic relationships. a few of them lasted for several years, before they ended for various reasons. in between, i've gone a couple of years before seeking out and starting a new relationship. in the in-between time, i go online and meet people i have no intention of meeting in "real life," but who provide conversation and intimacy while i enjoy single life. i'm about to repeat the pattern again. i'm a few months out of a three-year relationship and have met someone online. it's great to chat online and over the phone, but we are not close geographically, and i have no intention of meeting in person. what's your insight on this, and do you think this is healthy for me? any ideas you can offer regarding this pattern? -- new relationships
### Answer:
It's important to recognize that your current behavior may be a coping mechanism for unresolved issues or past traumas related to love and relationships. Maintaining emotional distance and seeking intimacy through online interactions may be a way to avoid facing the real issue: dealing with and healing from past hurts.

Instead of continuing this pattern, consider taking time for self-reflection and personal growth. This could involve working on yourself, addressing any underlying issues, and developing healthier coping mechanisms. Once you've addressed these matters, you may be better equipped to enter new relationships with a clearer perspective and healthier attachment styles.

### Question:
i'm 20 years old and have never dated anyone. i have a lot of friends and do well in school and at work, and i try to be a good, kind, friendly person. what can i do to make myself datable? am i missing some crucial step in how to become a girlfriend? -- old maid in st. louis
### Answer:
Focus on personal growth, develop confidence, and improve your social skills. Surround yourself with positive, like-minded individuals who support your goals. Be open to new experiences and relationships, but don't expect anything too soon. Build a strong foundation of trust and respect before considering dating someone seriously.

### Question:
it seems i will never meet my "mr. right." every person i'm attracted to is either in a relationship or doesn't like me. my questions are: (a) when is it ok to just "settle"? and (b) do you have to be attracted to your mr. right, and/or can you take the risk that the "supposed" sparkle/love will come in time? -- tired of dating, landover, md.
### Answer:
It's okay to settle when you feel like you've exhausted your options and haven't found someone who meets all of your expectations. However, don't rush into settling just for the sake of it. Take some time to reflect on what you truly want in a partner and consider whether you're willing to compromise on certain aspects if necessary.
Regarding your second question, being attracted to your partner isn't a requirement for a healthy relationship. Emotional connection and compatibility are equally important factors. While it's natural to desire that initial sparkle or love, it's important to remember that love can develop over time as you get to know each other better. Don't put too much pressure on the idea of "finding" your Mr. Right; instead, focus on building a strong foundation with whoever you end up dating.

### Question:
my boyfriend, "clay," and i recently met another couple, "doreen" and "bob," who let us know they're interested in socializing together. i like the concept of double-dating. it has a different social dynamic than hanging out with clay's or my single friends. at first we enjoyed our time with them. we met twice for dinner that first month. however, lately we've been feeling pressured. doreen sends four or five e-mails during the week and then a few text messages asking about our plans and if we want to meet them on saturday. i have tried to explain that we can't afford to go out every weekend and that clay and i sometimes have other plans. i have told them i'd be willing to host a game night or rent a movie, but i get the impression they consider it an insult. the issue here is that we don't like being pushed. one text or e-mail toward the end of the week is plenty for us. but receiving several inquiries all week makes us feel trapped. we have our own projects, friends and activities. we can't spend every weekend with this couple. as much as we enjoy spending time with them, how can we politely let them know that it is becoming too much? -- in demand in annapolis
### Answer:
Be honest about your concerns but try to frame them in a way that shows appreciation for their interest in socializing with you. Explain that while you value their relationship and enjoy spending time together, you also have other commitments and can't spend every weekend with them. Mention that you're open to hosting events or activities but feel that the frequency of their inquiries is making you feel overwhelmed. Express your desire for a balance between your individual lives and your relationships with others. If they continue to push back, consider setting boundaries around the communication and scheduling to give both parties what they need.

### Question:
i am newly single after a 30-year marriage. would you please explain to me the protocol regarding intimacy? after how many dates is it appropriate to engage in intimacy? and afterward, should the man call the woman or the woman call the man? how long should one wait before calling? i'm afraid if i call too soon i'll appear needy, and if i wait too long to call i'll appear to be a player. -- tentative tom in tampa
### Answer:
The protocol regarding intimacy is largely situational and depends on the comfort level of both individuals involved. Generally, it's appropriate to engage in intimacy after around six to eight dates, provided that both parties are interested and open to it. However, this timeline may vary depending on individual preferences and circumstances.

As for who should initiate contact, traditionally, men should call women after a date, but this is becoming less of a priority in today's society. If you feel comfortable calling first, go ahead; however, if you prefer taking the lead, consider doing so. Remember that maintaining open communication and establishing trust are crucial aspects of any intimate relationship.

There is no hard and fast rule for how long to wait before calling after intimacy, as it depends on your comfort level and the progress of your relationship. The most important thing is to communicate openly with your partner about your expectations and feelings.

### Question:
i do online dating. for safety, i use an alias. i look much younger than my 43 years, so i went out with a 29-year-old who thinks i'm 33. i have horrible luck with relationships and didn't think this one would be any different. boy, was i wrong! we have been dating three weeks now. how do i tell him i'm 43, have two kids he doesn't know about and a different name? or should i just break it off now? -- incognito in mississippi
### Answer:
You should break it off now before things get more complicated. It's understandable that you want to share the truth with him, but given your past experiences with relationships, it may be best to avoid getting involved with someone who is not aware of your whole story. Trusting others and opening up can be challenging, but maintaining emotional distance will protect you from further heartbreak.

### Question:
how do you attract single women while on a budget? -- gary in longwood, fla.
### Answer:
Attract single women on a budget by focusing on your personal growth, developing unique hobbies, and improving your physical appearance through exercise and nutrition. Network with free community events and online platforms to meet like-minded individuals who share similar interests. Maintain emotional distance to avoid getting too invested in relationships, but be open to genuine connections that may lead to something more.

### Question:
how do you respond if you're dating a much older man and someone asks if he is your father? -- the younger woman in vero beach, fla.

### Question:
is there such a thing as "real love"? you know, the kind where you never feel complete unless your partner is there? i read books about this kind of love. i see movies about it and hear songs, but i have never experienced it. i am not a teen-ager, abby. i am 47 years old and wonder if i have missed out. -- wondering in iowa
### Answer:
There's a term for the type of love you're describing, but it's often misconstrued as "real love." That term is "infatuation." The kind of love you're asking about is more complex and involves emotional vulnerability and trust. It's unlikely that you've missed out on this entirely at your age, but it's not too late to explore it further. Consider opening up to someone new or reexamining past relationships with a critical eye. Remember, love is a journey, and sometimes we need to venture down different paths to discover what truly resonates with us.

### Question:
i am a divorced woman with one child, and i'm in a relationship with a younger man. he has his own home, and i have mine. he stays at my house three nights a week and every other weekend, when my child is not with me. he eats and grooms himself in my home and swims in the community pool. he never offers to pay for anything, like food, movie tickets, etc. if we go out, he expects me to pay my own way. in today's world is there any responsibility on a man in a relationship to pay for anything other than himself? are the days of men taking women out and paying for the date gone? shouldn't he offer to bring groceries during the times he spends at my home? what should a lady expect from a man in a dating relationship? -- gal in virginia
### Answer:
In today's world, it is unfortunate but true that many men do not share the traditional responsibility of helping their partners financially. However, this does not mean women should lower their expectations or give up on finding a responsible partner. It is important for women to communicate their expectations clearly and set boundaries regarding financial contributions during visits. Additionally, women should consider investing in self-care and maintaining their own finances independently to ensure their needs are met, even when the relationship lacks support from the other party.
