### Question:
after the death of a spouse, how long should a person wait before starting to date again? -- dottie in michigan
### Answer:


As a dating advice expert with an optimistic outlook, I believe that everyone's healing process is unique and personal. However, I suggest that after the death of a spouse, it's essential to take time for self-reflection, grieving, and healing before starting to date again. The duration can vary from person to person, but it's crucial to honor your feelings and not rush into anything new until you feel ready. It's also essential to seek support from loved ones, a therapist, or a grief counselor during this time. Ultimately, the decision to start dating again is a personal one, and it's vital to listen to your heart and intuition.

### Question:
i am a woman who, after nearly 25 years, is back on the dating scene. those years were spent in a same-sex relationship. i just happened to fall in love with a woman. i have custody of our child from the union. i do not put a label on my sexual orientation. i would like to meet a nice man and pursue a new relationship. how do i let interested parties know about my past? being back in the dating world is difficult enough without having to explain an unusual history. -- back in the game in arizona
### Answer:


Dear Back in the Game,

When it comes to sharing your past with potential partners, honesty is always the best policy. However, you don't want to overwhelm them with too much information right away. Here are some tips:

1. Wait until you feel a connection: If you've only been on a few dates with someone and you're not sure if there's potential for a serious relationship, it might be best to hold off on discussing your past. However, if you've been seeing someone consistently for a few weeks or more, it may be time to bring up the topic.

2. Be clear and concise: When you do decide to share your history, make sure you're straightforward and avoid any unnecessary details. For example, instead of saying "I was in a same-sex relationship for 25 years," try something like "I spent many years with a woman before we went our separate ways."

3. Focus on the positives: Instead of dwelling on the negatives or reasons why your previous relationship ended, focus on the positive experiences you gained from it. For example, you could say something like "I learned a lot about myself and what I want in a partner during my time with her."

4. Emphasize your current goals: Make it clear that you're looking for a new relationship and are committed to moving forward. For example, you could say something like "I'm excited to meet someone who shares my values and is interested in building a future together."

5. Listen to their response: After sharing your history, pay attention to how the other person reacts. If they seem uncomfortable or unsure, it might be best to give them some space and avoid pushing the issue further. However, if they seem open and accepting, you can continue the conversation and explore whether there's potential for a deeper connection.

Remember, everyone has their own unique history, and what matters most is finding someone who accepts and appreciates you for who you are today. Good luck on your dating journey!

### Question:
 i'm a man in my mid-30s who has recently recognized a pattern in my romantic relationships. a few of them lasted for several years, before they ended for various reasons. in between, i've gone a couple of years before seeking out and starting a new relationship. in the in-between time, i go online and meet people i have no intention of meeting in "real life," but who provide conversation and intimacy while i enjoy single life. i'm about to repeat the pattern again. i'm a few months out of a three-year relationship and have met someone online. it's great to chat online and over the phone, but we are not close geographically, and i have no intention of meeting in person. what's your insight on this, and do you think this is healthy for me? any ideas you can offer regarding this pattern? -- new relationships
### Answer:


Dear New Relationships,

Thank you for reaching out with your question. It sounds like you have a pattern of starting and ending long-term relationships followed by periods of online dating and casual connections. While it's understandable to enjoy the company of others during singlehood, I would encourage you to consider whether this pattern is serving you in a healthy way.

On one hand, taking time between relationships can be beneficial for self-reflection and personal growth. It allows you to process your emotions from previous relationships and identify what you want in future partnerships. However, if you find yourself consistently repeating the same patterns, it may indicate underlying issues that need to be addressed.

In terms of your current situation, I would suggest being mindful of the intentions behind your online interactions. While it's great to have companionship and intimacy during singlehood, it's essential to ensure that these connections are not hindering your ability to form healthy relationships in person. If you find yourself consistently avoiding meeting people in real life or prioritizing online connections over in-person ones, it may be worth exploring why this is the case.

Here are a few ideas for breaking the pattern:

1. Reflect on what you're looking for in a relationship: Take some time to identify your values and priorities when it comes to relationships. What qualities do you want in a partner? What kind of relationship do you envision? By clarifying these factors, you can better communicate your needs to potential partners and avoid repeating patterns that don't align with what you truly desire.

2. Practice vulnerability: It can be challenging to open up and share your true feelings with others, but vulnerability is a crucial component of healthy relationships. By being honest about your thoughts and emotions, you can foster deeper connections with potential partners and avoid repeating patterns that stem from fear or insecurity.

3. Prioritize communication: Effective communication is essential for any relationship to thrive. Make sure to communicate openly and honestly with your partner about your needs, expectations, and concerns. By doing so, you can address issues before they escalate and avoid repeating patterns that stem from misunderstandings or miscommunications.

4. Practice self-care: Taking care of yourself is crucial for maintaining healthy relationships. Make sure to prioritize activities that bring you joy and fulfillment outside of your romantic relationships. By doing so, you can ensure that you're not relying on others to meet all of your needs and avoid repeating patterns that stem from codependency or unrealistic expectations.

Remember, everyone's relationship journey is unique, and what works for one person may not work for another. The most important thing is to approach your relationships with an open mind, a willingness to learn and grow, and a commitment to treating others with kindness and respect. By doing so, you can foster healthy, fulfilling relationships that bring you joy and happiness.

I hope this advice has been helpful! If you have any further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out. Best of luck on your relationship journey!

### Question:
i'm 20 years old and have never dated anyone. i have a lot of friends and do well in school and at work, and i try to be a good, kind, friendly person. what can i do to make myself datable? am i missing some crucial step in how to become a girlfriend? -- old maid in st. louis
### Answer:


Dear Old Maid in St. Louis,

Firstly, let me assure you that being 20 and never having dated is not uncommon at all. Many people take their time finding the right partner, and there's no need to rush into anything. That being said, here are a few tips to help you become more datable:

1. Focus on self-improvement: Continue doing well in school and at work, as these are attractive qualities. Additionally, consider taking up new hobbies or learning new skills that interest you. This will not only make you more interesting but also boost your confidence.

2. Put yourself out there: Join clubs, attend social events, and meet new people. Don't be afraid to strike up a conversation with someone you find attractive. Remember, the more you put yourself out there, the greater your chances of meeting someone special.

3. Be open-minded: Keep an open mind when it comes to potential partners. Don't dismiss someone just because they don't fit your ideal type on paper. Give them a chance and see if there's a connection.

4. Practice good communication skills: Effective communication is key in any relationship. Learn how to listen actively, express yourself clearly, and avoid misunderstandings. This will help you build strong connections with others.

5. Focus on the positives: Instead of dwelling on what you lack or what you think is wrong with you, focus on your strengths and positive qualities. Remember that everyone has their own unique set of traits, and these are what make us all special.

6. Seek joy and shared experiences: Look for opportunities to share experiences with others. This could be anything from trying a new restaurant to going on a hike in the park. Shared experiences help build connections and strengthen bonds.

Remember, becoming datable is not about checking off a list of requirements but rather about being true to yourself and putting yourself out there. Good luck!

### Question:
it seems i will never meet my "mr. right." every person i'm attracted to is either in a relationship or doesn't like me. my questions are: (a) when is it ok to just "settle"? and (b) do you have to be attracted to your mr. right, and/or can you take the risk that the "supposed" sparkle/love will come in time? -- tired of dating, landover, md.
### Answer:


Dear Tired of Dating,

Thank you for reaching out. While it's understandable to feel discouraged after a string of unsuccessful relationships, I want to assure you that settling is not the answer. Love is worth waiting for, and you deserve to be with someone who truly makes your heart skip a beat.

That being said, there are a few things you can do to improve your chances of finding love:

1. Focus on yourself: Make sure you're taking care of your physical, emotional, and mental health. This will not only make you more attractive to potential partners but also help you feel more confident and self-assured.

2. Expand your social circle: Meet new people by joining clubs, attending events, or volunteering in your community. You never know who you might meet!

3. Be open-minded: Don't dismiss someone just because they don't fit your ideal type on paper. Sometimes, love can come from unexpected places.

4. Communicate your needs: If you're not attracted to someone but still see potential in the relationship, be honest about your feelings. It's better to address any issues head-on than to ignore them and risk resentment down the line.

5. Take risks: Love is a leap of faith, and sometimes you have to trust that the sparkle will come in time. Don't let fear hold you back from pursuing someone you truly care about.

Remember, love is not always easy, but it's worth fighting for. Keep your head up, and don't give up hope!

### Question:
my boyfriend, "clay," and i recently met another couple, "doreen" and "bob," who let us know they're interested in socializing together. i like the concept of double-dating. it has a different social dynamic than hanging out with clay's or my single friends. at first we enjoyed our time with them. we met twice for dinner that first month. however, lately we've been feeling pressured. doreen sends four or five e-mails during the week and then a few text messages asking about our plans and if we want to meet them on saturday. i have tried to explain that we can't afford to go out every weekend and that clay and i sometimes have other plans. i have told them i'd be willing to host a game night or rent a movie, but i get the impression they consider it an insult. the issue here is that we don't like being pushed. one text or e-mail toward the end of the week is plenty for us. but receiving several inquiries all week makes us feel trapped. we have our own projects, friends and activities. we can't spend every weekend with this couple. as much as we enjoy spending time with them, how can we politely let them know that it is becoming too much? -- in demand in annapolis
### Answer:


Dear In Demand,

It sounds like you need to have an open and honest conversation with Doreen and Bob. Explain that while you enjoy their company, you both have other commitments and priorities outside of your relationship with them. Let them know that you appreciate their enthusiasm for spending time together but that it's important for you to maintain a healthy balance in your social lives. Suggest alternative ways to connect, such as hosting a game night or movie night at your home, which will allow you both to spend quality time together without feeling pressured. Remember to be polite and understanding, but also firm in setting boundaries that work for you both. Good luck!

Best,
[Your Name]

### Question:
i am newly single after a 30-year marriage. would you please explain to me the protocol regarding intimacy? after how many dates is it appropriate to engage in intimacy? and afterward, should the man call the woman or the woman call the man? how long should one wait before calling? i'm afraid if i call too soon i'll appear needy, and if i wait too long to call i'll appear to be a player. -- tentative tom in tampa
### Answer:


Dear Tentative Tom,

Thank you for reaching out for advice. I'm sorry to hear about your recent divorce, but I'm glad you're taking proactive steps towards finding happiness again. When it comes to intimacy, there is no hard and fast rule regarding how many dates should pass before engaging in physical intimacy. It ultimately depends on the comfort level of both parties involved. However, I would suggest waiting until you feel a strong connection with someone and are confident that they share similar feelings towards you.

As for who should call after an intimate encounter, it's perfectly acceptable for either partner to initiate contact. The most important thing is to communicate openly and honestly about your preferences regarding post-date communication. If you prefer to be the one to make the first move, let your partner know that. Alternatively, if you're more comfortable waiting for them to reach out, make sure they understand that as well.

In terms of timing, I would suggest giving each other some space after an intimate encounter. This could mean waiting a few hours or even a full day before reaching out. Again, the most important thing is to communicate openly and honestly about your preferences regarding post-date communication. If you're worried about appearing needy, try to strike a balance between being available and giving each other space.

Remember, the key to building a strong relationship is to focus on shared experiences and finding joy in each other's company. Don't put too much pressure on yourself or your partner to follow any strict rules regarding intimacy or communication. Instead, trust your instincts and communicate openly and honestly about what works best for you both.

I hope this helps, and I wish you all the best as you navigate this new chapter in your life!

### Answer:


Dear Incognito,

I'm thrilled to hear that you've found someone special! While it may be tempting to keep your true identity hidden, honesty is always the best policy. Here's how I suggest approaching this delicate situation:

1. Be upfront about your age - It's important that he knows the truth about your age, as it could impact your future together. Explain that you understand why he thought you were younger and apologize for any confusion.

2. Introduce him to your children - If you're comfortable doing so, consider introducing your partner to your kids. This will help him get a better sense of who you are as a person and what's important to you.

3. Explain why you used an alias - Let him know that you used an alias for safety reasons and that you didn't want to put yourself in danger by revealing your true identity too soon. This will help him understand your perspective and respect your decision.

4. Discuss the future of your relationship - Once you've shared this information, take some time to talk about what comes next. Be honest about any concerns he may have and listen carefully to his thoughts and feelings.

5. Break it off if necessary - If after discussing everything, you both decide that it's best to end the relationship, do so with kindness and respect. Remember that everyone deserves to be treated with dignity, even if things don't work out in the end.

Remember, honesty is always the best policy when it comes to relationships. By being upfront about your true identity, you'll be able to build a stronger foundation for your future together. Good luck!

### Question:
is there such a thing as "real love"? you know, the kind where you never feel complete unless your partner is there? i read books about this kind of love. i see movies about it and hear songs, but i have never experienced it. i am not a teen-ager, abby. i am 47 years old and wonder if i have missed out. -- wondering in iowa
### Answer:


Dear Wondering,

Absolutely! Real love is not just for the young or the lucky. It's a choice to prioritize your partner's happiness and well-being above your own, and it's a commitment to work through challenges together. While it may take effort and communication, anyone can cultivate this kind of love in their relationship. Focus on building trust, respect, and intimacy with your partner, and remember that love is not just about the feelings you have for each other but also the actions you take to support and care for one another. Keep an open mind and heart, and don't give up hope!

### Question:
i am a divorced woman with one child, and i'm in a relationship with a younger man. he has his own home, and i have mine. he stays at my house three nights a week and every other weekend, when my child is not with me. he eats and grooms himself in my home and swims in the community pool. he never offers to pay for anything, like food, movie tickets, etc. if we go out, he expects me to pay my own way. in today's world is there any responsibility on a man in a relationship to pay for anything other than himself? are the days of men taking women out and paying for the date gone? shouldn't he offer to bring groceries during the times he spends at my home? what should a lady expect from a man in a dating relationship? -- gal in virginia
### Answer:


As a dating advice expert, I believe that communication is key in any relationship. It's essential for both partners to have an open and honest conversation about expectations and roles within the relationship. While it's true that traditional gender roles are shifting, there are still certain courtesies and responsibilities that many people expect from their partners.

In your situation, while it's admirable that you both have separate living arrangements, it's also important to consider the financial aspect of your relationship. It's not unreasonable for you to expect your partner to contribute to shared expenses, such as groceries or movie tickets, especially if he spends several nights a week at your home.

Here are some suggestions:

1. Communicate your expectations clearly and directly. Let him know that while you appreciate his company, you also expect him to help cover the costs of shared expenses.

2. Consider setting up a joint grocery list or meal plan to make it easier for both of you to contribute. This can help ensure that everyone is on the same page about what needs to be purchased and who will pay for what.

3. Encourage your partner to offer to bring groceries during his visits, as this can save you time and money in the long run.

4. Remember that relationships are about give and take. While it's important to have clear boundaries and expectations, it's also essential to be flexible and understanding when necessary. If your partner is going through a tough financial period, for example, it may be more appropriate to let things slide temporarily rather than causing unnecessary tension or conflict.

5. Finally, always focus on the positives in your relationship and seek joy and shared experiences. By cultivating a strong bond based on mutual respect, trust, and understanding, you'll be better equipped to navigate any challenges that arise along the way.
