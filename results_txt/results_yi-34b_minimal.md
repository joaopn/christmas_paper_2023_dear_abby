### Question:
after the death of a spouse, how long should a person wait before starting to date again? -- dottie in michigan
### Answer:
There is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question. It's different for everyone and depends on the individual's emotional state, grief process, and personal comfort level. Some people may feel ready to date again within a few months, while others may take years. It's important to give yourself time to heal and not rush into a new relationship before you're truly ready. If you're unsure, consider speaking with a therapist or counselor who can provide guidance tailored to your specific situation.

### Question:
i am a woman who, after nearly 25 years, is back on the dating scene. those years were spent in a same-sex relationship. i just happened to fall in love with a woman. i have custody of our child from the union. i do not put a label on my sexual orientation. i would like to meet a nice man and pursue a new relationship. how do i let interested parties know about my past? being back in the dating world is difficult enough without having to explain an unusual history. -- back in the game in arizona
### Answer:
It's important to be honest and open about your past, but you don't need to share every detail right away. When you feel comfortable with someone, you can choose to disclose your history at a pace that feels right for you. Remember, the right person will accept you for who you are today.

### Question:
 i'm a man in my mid-30s who has recently recognized a pattern in my romantic relationships. a few of them lasted for several years, before they ended for various reasons. in between, i've gone a couple of years before seeking out and starting a new relationship. in the in-between time, i go online and meet people i have no intention of meeting in "real life," but who provide conversation and intimacy while i enjoy single life. i'm about to repeat the pattern again. i'm a few months out of a three-year relationship and have met someone online. it's great to chat online and over the phone, but we are not close geographically, and i have no intention of meeting in person. what's your insight on this, and do you think this is healthy for me? any ideas you can offer regarding this pattern? -- new relationships
### Answer:
It sounds like you're seeking a casual connection without the commitment or expectations of a traditional relationship. While there's nothing inherently wrong with this, it's important to be honest with yourself and your partners about what you're looking for. Casual relationships can be perfectly fulfilling if they meet your needs and desires. However, if you find that these connections are not satisfying on a deeper level or if you start to yearn for more, it may be worth reflecting on what you truly want in a relationship and whether it's time to reevaluate your approach.

### Question:
i'm 20 years old and have never dated anyone. i have a lot of friends and do well in school and at work, and i try to be a good, kind, friendly person. what can i do to make myself datable? am i missing some crucial step in how to become a girlfriend? -- old maid in st. louis
### Answer:
It's important to remember that being "datable" is not about achieving a specific status or following a formula. It's about being the best version of yourself and presenting that to the world. Here are some tips to help you on your journey:

1. **Confidence**: Work on building your self-confidence. This doesn't mean being arrogant, but rather feeling good about who you are and what you have to offer.

2. **Personality**: Be genuine and let your personality shine through. People are attracted to unique traits and interests, so don't be afraid to show who you truly are.

3. **Appearance**: While it's not the most important aspect, taking care of your appearance can make a difference. This doesn't mean conforming to societal standards but feeling good about how you look.

4. **Social Skills**: Improve your social skills by being an active listener and engaging in conversations with others. This will help you connect on a deeper level.

5. **Goals and Hobbies**: Have goals for yourself and hobbies that you enjoy. Sharing these passions can be attractive to potential partners.

6. **Be Open**: Be open to meeting new people and trying new things. You never know where you might find someone who clicks with you.

7. **Patience**: Dating can sometimes feel like a roller coaster, but remember that it's also a process. Be patient with yourself and the journey.

8. **Reflect**: Take time to reflect on what you want in a relationship and what you have to offer. This will help you attract people who align with your values and interests.

Remember, there is no one-size-fits-all approach to dating. It's about finding someone who appreciates you for who you are. Don't try to be someone you're not in order to fit a mold; instead, focus on being the best version of yourself.

### Question:
it seems i will never meet my "mr. right." every person i'm attracted to is either in a relationship or doesn't like me. my questions are: (a) when is it ok to just "settle"? and (b) do you have to be attracted to your mr. right, and/or can you take the risk that the "supposed" sparkle/love will come in time? -- tired of dating, landover, md.
### Answer:
(a) Settling is a personal decision and depends on your values and what you're willing to compromise on. It's important to reflect on what aspects are most important to you in a partner and be honest with yourself about whether you can be happy with someone who may not meet all of your initial expectations.

(b) Attraction is often an essential component of relationships, but it's also possible that feelings can develop over time. Sometimes, people who initially don't feel a strong spark can grow to love and be attracted to each other as they get to know one another better. It's a matter of personal preference and what you're willing to explore in the context of a relationship.

Remember, there is no one-size-fits-all answer when it comes to relationships. Everyone's experience is unique, and what works for one person may not work for another. It's important to listen to your heart and make decisions that are right for you.

### Question:
my boyfriend, "clay," and i recently met another couple, "doreen" and "bob," who let us know they're interested in socializing together. i like the concept of double-dating. it has a different social dynamic than hanging out with clay's or my single friends. at first we enjoyed our time with them. we met twice for dinner that first month. however, lately we've been feeling pressured. doreen sends four or five e-mails during the week and then a few text messages asking about our plans and if we want to meet them on saturday. i have tried to explain that we can't afford to go out every weekend and that clay and i sometimes have other plans. i have told them i'd be willing to host a game night or rent a movie, but i get the impression they consider it an insult. the issue here is that we don't like being pushed. one text or e-mail toward the end of the week is plenty for us. but receiving several inquiries all week makes us feel trapped. we have our own projects, friends and activities. we can't spend every weekend with this couple. as much as we enjoy spending time with them, how can we politely let them know that it is becoming too much? -- in demand in annapolis
### Answer:
It sounds like you and your boyfriend are feeling overwhelmed by the frequency of communication from Doreen and Bob. It's important to set boundaries in any relationship, including friendships, to ensure that everyone's needs are respected. Here are a few suggestions on how to handle the situation:

1. **Communicate Your Needs**: Have a conversation with Doreen and Bob about your feelings. Explain that while you enjoy their company, the constant barrage of messages is making you feel pressured and that you value your alone time and other commitments.

2. **Set Clear Expectations**: Let them know what you're comfortable with in terms of communication frequency. Suggest a more manageable pace, such as one check-in per week to discuss plans for the weekend.

3. **Suggest Alternatives**: Offer alternative ways to stay connected that might feel less demanding for you, like group messages or planning activities that can accommodate all your schedules without the pressure of frequent meetups.

4. **Be Assertive but Polite**: It's important to be firm in expressing your needs while also being respectful and kind. Avoid blaming them for the situation and instead focus on finding a solution that works for everyone.

5. **Stick to Your Boundaries**: Once you've communicated your boundaries, stick to them. If they continue to overwhelm you with messages, it may be necessary to address it again or consider if this friendship is truly meeting your needs.

Remember, it's okay to prioritize your own well-being and set limits in any relationship. Friends should respect each other's boundaries and find a balance that allows everyone to feel comfortable and valued.

### Question:
i am newly single after a 30-year marriage. would you please explain to me the protocol regarding intimacy? after how many dates is it appropriate to engage in intimacy? and afterward, should the man call the woman or the woman call the man? how long should one wait before calling? i'm afraid if i call too soon i'll appear needy, and if i wait too long to call i'll appear to be a player. -- tentative tom in tampa
### Answer:
In the modern dating world, there is no strict protocol or timeline for when it's appropriate to engage in intimacy. It's important to communicate openly with your partner and ensure that both of you are comfortable and ready. As for who should call after a date, it's always best to discuss this between you and your partner. Some people prefer traditional roles where the man calls the woman, while others may choose to take turns or alternate calling each other. There is no right or wrong answer as long as both parties are comfortable with the arrangement. As for waiting before calling, it's generally a good idea to wait at least a day or two to avoid appearing too eager, but again, this depends on the comfort level of both people involved. Remember that everyone moves at their own pace in relationships, so it's crucial to find what works best for you and your partner.

### Question:
i do online dating. for safety, i use an alias. i look much younger than my 43 years, so i went out with a 29-year-old who thinks i'm 33. i have horrible luck with relationships and didn't think this one would be any different. boy, was i wrong! we have been dating three weeks now. how do i tell him i'm 43, have two kids he doesn't know about and a different name? or should i just break it off now? -- incognito in mississippi
### Answer:
It's important to be honest with your partner. However, the way you reveal your true self can make a big difference. Instead of focusing on the negatives (your age, children, and different name), emphasize the positives of who you are and what you bring to the relationship. Be open and vulnerable, but also consider his reaction and whether this relationship is worth pursuing given the potential complications.

### Question:

### Answer:
To attract single women while on a budget, focus on creating an attractive and genuine persona, being confident, and engaging in thoughtful conversations. Additionally, be respectful, kind, and attentive to their needs and desires. Remember that building a connection is more important than spending money.

### Question:
how do you respond if you're dating a much older man and someone asks if he is your father? -- the younger woman in vero beach, fla.
### Answer:
If you're dating a much older man and someone asks if he is your father, it's important to be honest but also respectful of both your relationship and his age. You might choose to respond with something like: "No, he's not my father. We're in a relationship together."

### Question:
is there such a thing as "real love"? you know, the kind where you never feel complete unless your partner is there? i read books about this kind of love. i see movies about it and hear songs, but i have never experienced it. i am not a teen-ager, abby. i am 47 years old and wonder if i have missed out. -- wondering in iowa
### Answer:
Yes, there is such a thing as "real love." It's the deep, passionate, and all-consuming emotion that you describe. It's not limited to teenagers; it can happen at any age. However, it's important to remember that love also requires work, understanding, and communication. If you haven't experienced it yet, don't despair. Keep an open heart and mind, and it may find you when you least expect it.

### Question:
i am a divorced woman with one child, and i'm in a relationship with a younger man. he has his own home, and i have mine. he stays at my house three nights a week and every other weekend, when my child is not with me. he eats and grooms himself in my home and swims in the community pool. he never offers to pay for anything, like food, movie tickets, etc. if we go out, he expects me to pay my own way. in today's world is there any responsibility on a man in a relationship to pay for anything other than himself? are the days of men taking women out and paying for the date gone? shouldn't he offer to bring groceries during the times he spends at my home? what should a lady expect from a man in a dating relationship? -- gal in virginia
### Answer:
In today's world, there is no strict rule that a man must pay for everything in a dating relationship. However, it is generally expected that both partners will contribute to the relationship in some way, whether it's financially or by taking on other responsibilities. It seems like you are already contributing by allowing him to stay at your home and providing access to amenities. It would be fair to expect him to contribute as well, such as by helping with groceries or pitching in for shared expenses when he is at your house. Communication is key in any relationship, so it might be helpful to discuss this matter openly with your partner to establish mutual expectations and responsibilities.
