### Question:
after the death of a spouse, how long should a person wait before starting to date again? -- dottie in michigan
### Answer:
 Dear Dottie, I'm sorry for your loss. It's important to take time and grieve properly before considering dating again. Healing takes different amounts of time for everyone - some people may be ready sooner than others. However, it is generally recommended that you wait at least six months after the death of a spouse before starting to date again. This allows you enough time to process your emotions and adjust to life without your partner. Remember, there's no rush in this journey; take all the time you need for yourself and when you're ready, start exploring new connections with care and consideration. Best wishes on your healing path! - Abigail


### Question:
i am a woman who, after nearly 25 years, is back on the dating scene. those years were spent in a same-sex relationship. i just happened to fall in love with a woman. i have custody of our child from the union. i do not put a label on my sexual orientation. i would like to meet a nice man and pursue a new relationship. how do i let interested parties know about my past? being back in the dating world is difficult enough without having to explain an unusual history. -- back in the game in arizona
### Answer:
 Dear Reader, 
It's great that you're ready to explore new relationships after such a long time! It can be challenging when your past experiences are different from what most people expect or understand. Here are some suggestions on how to approach this situation: 1) Be honest and upfront about your history with the person you're interested in, but don't feel like you have to explain every detail. 2) Focus on the present moment and let them get to know who you are now, rather than dwelling too much on your past. 3) Remember that everyone has their own unique story, and it's okay if someone doesn't understand or accept yours right away. 4) Surround yourself with supportive friends and family members who will be there for you no matter what happens. Good luck!


### Question:
 i'm a man in my mid-30s who has recently recognized a pattern in my romantic relationships. a few of them lasted for several years, before they ended for various reasons. in between, i've gone a couple of years before seeking out and starting a new relationship. in the in-between time, i go online and meet people i have no intention of meeting in "real life," but who provide conversation and intimacy while i enjoy single life. i'm about to repeat the pattern again. i'm a few months out of a three-year relationship and have met someone online. it's great to chat online and over the phone, but we are not close geographically, and i have no intention of meeting in person. what's your insight on this, and do you think this is healthy for me? any ideas you can offer regarding this pattern? -- new relationships
### Answer:
 Dear Reader, It sounds like you're experiencing a common cycle that many people go through when it comes to romantic relationships. While online interactions can be enjoyable and provide temporary intimacy, they should not replace the opportunity to meet someone in person and build a deeper connection. Meeting face-to-face allows for better communication, understanding of body language, and the chance to truly get to know each other on a more personal level. It's important to consider whether your online interactions are fulfilling your emotional needs or if they're simply providing temporary satisfaction without any real substance. If you find yourself consistently seeking out relationships that end after only a few years but then quickly moving on again, it may be worth exploring the reasons behind this pattern and working towards building more meaningful connections with others. Remember to prioritize open communication, honesty, and mutual respect in all your future relationships. Best of luck!


### Question:
i'm 20 years old and have never dated anyone. i have a lot of friends and do well in school and at work, and i try to be a good, kind, friendly person. what can i do to make myself datable? am i missing some crucial step in how to become a girlfriend? -- old maid in st. louis
### Answer:
 Dear Old Maid, It's great that you're open-minded about dating! First of all, don't worry too much if you haven't dated anyone yet - it happens to many people at your age. To make yourself more attractive as a potential partner, focus on being the best version of yourself. Continue excelling in school and work, maintain good manners and respect for others, and be friendly with everyone around you. Remember that confidence is key! Also, don't hesitate to join social activities or clubs where you can meet new people who share similar interests as you. Good luck on your dating journey!


### Question:
it seems i will never meet my "mr. right." every person i'm attracted to is either in a relationship or doesn't like me. my questions are: (a) when is it ok to just "settle"? and (b) do you have to be attracted to your mr. right, and/or can you take the risk that the "supposed" sparkle/love will come in time? -- tired of dating, landover, md.
### Answer:
 Dear Reader, It's understandable that it feels like finding Mr. Right is an impossible task for you at this point in your life. However, settling doesn't necessarily mean giving up on love or compromising your values and desires entirely. Sometimes we have to accept that the right person may not be available now but will come along when the time is right. It's important to remember that attraction can evolve over time, so don't dismiss someone just because they're currently in a relationship or if you feel like there isn't an immediate spark between you two. Keep your heart open and trust that love has its own timing. Best of luck on your journey! - Abigail


### Question:
my boyfriend, "clay," and i recently met another couple, "doreen" and "bob," who let us know they're interested in socializing together. i like the concept of double-dating. it has a different social dynamic than hanging out with clay's or my single friends. at first we enjoyed our time with them. we met twice for dinner that first month. however, lately we've been feeling pressured. doreen sends four or five e-mails during the week and then a few text messages asking about our plans and if we want to meet them on saturday. i have tried to explain that we can't afford to go out every weekend and that clay and i sometimes have other plans. i have told them i'd be willing to host a game night or rent a movie, but i get the impression they consider it an insult. the issue here is that we don't like being pushed. one text or e-mail toward the end of the week is plenty for us. but receiving several inquiries all week makes us feel trapped. we have our own projects, friends and activities. we can't spend every weekend with this couple. as much as we enjoy spending time with them, how can we politely let them know that it is becoming too much? -- in demand in annapolis
### Answer:
 Dear In Demand, It's important to communicate your feelings honestly but kindly when you're feeling overwhelmed by someone else's expectations. Start by expressing gratitude for their interest and willingness to spend time together. Then explain that while you enjoy spending time with them, it can be challenging to meet up every weekend due to other commitments or plans. Suggest alternative activities like game nights or movie rentals as a compromise. Be clear about your boundaries and let them know that occasional texts are sufficient but constant inquiries make you feel trapped. Remember, open communication is key in any relationship!


### Question:
i am newly single after a 30-year marriage. would you please explain to me the protocol regarding intimacy? after how many dates is it appropriate to engage in intimacy? and afterward, should the man call the woman or the woman call the man? how long should one wait before calling? i'm afraid if i call too soon i'll appear needy, and if i wait too long to call i'll appear to be a player. -- tentative tom in tampa
### Answer:
 Dear Tom, I understand that you're feeling uncertain about when it's appropriate to engage in intimacy after being newly single for so many years. It can be difficult to navigate this new territory without any guidance or experience from your previous marriage. In general, the best approach is to wait until both parties feel comfortable and ready before engaging in physical intimacy. This may take some time, as you're likely adjusting to a whole new lifestyle after being married for so long. When it comes to calling each other afterwards, there's no set protocol that applies universally - every couple has their own unique dynamic and communication style. However, I would suggest waiting at least 24 hours before making any calls or initiating contact with your ex-spouse. This will give both of you time to process the end of the relationship and avoid any potential misunderstandings or hurt feelings. Remember, it's important to be patient with yourself as you navigate this new chapter in your life - take things one day at a time and don't hesitate to reach out for support if needed. Best wishes!

### Answer:
 Dear Incognito, It's great that you're taking steps to protect your identity while dating online. However, honesty is always the best policy when it comes to relationships. If you feel comfortable sharing this information with him and he respects your decision, then there's no need to break off the relationship now. Just be prepared for some initial surprises or questions from him about his age and family background. Remember that communication is key in any relationship, so make sure you're both on the same page before making a final decision. Best of luck!

### Question:
how do you respond if you're dating a much older man and someone asks if he is your father? -- the younger woman in vero beach, fla.
### Answer:
 Dear Vero Beach Woman, I would advise being honest about your relationship status to avoid any misunderstandings or hurt feelings. If it's appropriate for both parties involved, then you can share that you are dating an older man who may be your father. However, if this is a sensitive topic and could potentially cause discomfort or complications in the future, it might be best to keep this information private until further notice. Remember to always prioritize open communication and respect each other's boundaries in any relationship.


### Question:
is there such a thing as "real love"? you know, the kind where you never feel complete unless your partner is there? i read books about this kind of love. i see movies about it and hear songs, but i have never experienced it. i am not a teen-ager, abby. i am 47 years old and wonder if i have missed out. -- wondering in iowa
### Answer:
 Dear Reader, Love can be complex and multifaceted for everyone's experience is unique to them alone. While some may describe "real love" as an unshakeable bond where you feel complete without your partner, others might find fulfillment through different aspects of their relationships or personal growth. It's important to remember that there isn't a one-size-fits-all definition of true love and what works for someone else may not work for you. Focus on building strong connections based on mutual respect, trust, and understanding with your partner while also nurturing yourself as an individual. Love can take many forms throughout life, so embrace the journey and find happiness in whatever form it takes to you! - Abby


### Question:
i am a divorced woman with one child, and i'm in a relationship with a younger man. he has his own home, and i have mine. he stays at my house three nights a week and every other weekend, when my child is not with me. he eats and grooms himself in my home and swims in the community pool. he never offers to pay for anything, like food, movie tickets, etc. if we go out, he expects me to pay my own way. in today's world is there any responsibility on a man in a relationship to pay for anything other than himself? are the days of men taking women out and paying for the date gone? shouldn't he offer to bring groceries during the times he spends at my home? what should a lady expect from a man in a dating relationship? -- gal in virginia
### Answer:
 Dear Reader, It's important that you feel comfortable with your partner. If this arrangement is causing discomfort or unease for either of you, it may be time to have an open and honest conversation about expectations and boundaries. While there isn't necessarily a "responsibility" on men to pay for everything in a relationship, it can certainly be seen as a sign of respect and consideration if they offer to contribute financially when going out or doing activities together. It's also important that both partners feel valued and appreciated, regardless of who pays for what. Ultimately, the key is open communication and mutual understanding between you two. Best wishes! - Abby
