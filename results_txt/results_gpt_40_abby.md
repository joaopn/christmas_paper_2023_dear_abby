### Question:
after the death of a spouse, how long should a person wait before starting to date again? -- dottie in michigan
### Answer:
Dear Dottie,

There's no one-size-fits-all answer to this, as everyone grieves and heals at their own pace. It's important to ensure you've given yourself ample time to process your loss and feel ready to open your heart again. This could be a few months for some, or several years for others. The key is to listen to your own feelings and not rush. When you can think about dating without feeling guilty or disloyal to your late spouse, that's a good sign you may be ready.

### Question:
i am a woman who, after nearly 25 years, is back on the dating scene. those years were spent in a same-sex relationship. i just happened to fall in love with a woman. i have custody of our child from the union. i do not put a label on my sexual orientation. i would like to meet a nice man and pursue a new relationship. how do i let interested parties know about my past? being back in the dating world is difficult enough without having to explain an unusual history. -- back in the game in arizona
### Answer:
Dear Back in the Game,

Your past relationship is a part of your life story, and it's nothing to be ashamed of. When you feel comfortable and trust is established, you can share your history. You don't need to label your sexual orientation, but you can explain that you fell in love with a person, not a gender. Remember, anyone worth your time will understand and accept your past. Good luck in the dating world!

### Question:
 i'm a man in my mid-30s who has recently recognized a pattern in my romantic relationships. a few of them lasted for several years, before they ended for various reasons. in between, i've gone a couple of years before seeking out and starting a new relationship. in the in-between time, i go online and meet people i have no intention of meeting in "real life," but who provide conversation and intimacy while i enjoy single life. i'm about to repeat the pattern again. i'm a few months out of a three-year relationship and have met someone online. it's great to chat online and over the phone, but we are not close geographically, and i have no intention of meeting in person. what's your insight on this, and do you think this is healthy for me? any ideas you can offer regarding this pattern? -- new relationships
### Answer:
Dear New Relationships,

It's wonderful that you're self-aware enough to recognize your pattern. It's not inherently unhealthy to enjoy periods of single life or to seek companionship online. However, it's important to be honest with the people you're interacting with about your intentions. If they're under the impression that the relationship could become more serious or physical, it's only fair to let them know that's not your plan. As for your pattern, it might be worth exploring why you're comfortable with this cycle. Is it fear of commitment? Enjoyment of your independence? Understanding your motivations could help you make more fulfilling choices in the future. Remember, it's your life and your happiness that matters most. -- Abby

### Question:
i'm 20 years old and have never dated anyone. i have a lot of friends and do well in school and at work, and i try to be a good, kind, friendly person. what can i do to make myself datable? am i missing some crucial step in how to become a girlfriend? -- old maid in st. louis
### Answer:
Dear Old Maid in St. Louis,

Firstly, let's retire that moniker, shall we? You're 20, not 120. You're not missing a crucial step, you're simply on your own timeline. Continue being the good, kind, friendly person you are. Focus on your passions, interests, and self-growth. Love often comes when we're not looking for it. Remember, it's not about making yourself "datable" but about finding someone who appreciates you for who you are. Patience, dear. Your time will come.

### Question:
it seems i will never meet my "mr. right." every person i'm attracted to is either in a relationship or doesn't like me. my questions are: (a) when is it ok to just "settle"? and (b) do you have to be attracted to your mr. right, and/or can you take the risk that the "supposed" sparkle/love will come in time? -- tired of dating, landover, md.
### Answer:
Dear Tired of Dating,

(a) Never settle for less than what you deserve. It's better to be single and happy than in a relationship and miserable. (b) Attraction is important, but it's not everything. Love can grow over time, but it's a risk. Remember, your Mr. Right should be someone who respects you, treats you well, and makes you happy. Keep your standards high and your heart open. The right person is worth the wait.

### Question:
my boyfriend, "clay," and i recently met another couple, "doreen" and "bob," who let us know they're interested in socializing together. i like the concept of double-dating. it has a different social dynamic than hanging out with clay's or my single friends. at first we enjoyed our time with them. we met twice for dinner that first month. however, lately we've been feeling pressured. doreen sends four or five e-mails during the week and then a few text messages asking about our plans and if we want to meet them on saturday. i have tried to explain that we can't afford to go out every weekend and that clay and i sometimes have other plans. i have told them i'd be willing to host a game night or rent a movie, but i get the impression they consider it an insult. the issue here is that we don't like being pushed. one text or e-mail toward the end of the week is plenty for us. but receiving several inquiries all week makes us feel trapped. we have our own projects, friends and activities. we can't spend every weekend with this couple. as much as we enjoy spending time with them, how can we politely let them know that it is becoming too much? -- in demand in annapolis
### Answer:
Dear In Demand in Annapolis,

It's wonderful that you've found a couple you enjoy socializing with, but it's important to maintain balance in your social life. It's perfectly okay to set boundaries. The next time Doreen contacts you, be honest yet polite. Say something like, "We really enjoy spending time with you both, but we also have other commitments and plans. Let's aim for getting together once or twice a month." If they're truly your friends, they'll understand and respect your wishes. Remember, it's not about rejecting them, but about managing your time and maintaining a variety of relationships.

### Question:
i am newly single after a 30-year marriage. would you please explain to me the protocol regarding intimacy? after how many dates is it appropriate to engage in intimacy? and afterward, should the man call the woman or the woman call the man? how long should one wait before calling? i'm afraid if i call too soon i'll appear needy, and if i wait too long to call i'll appear to be a player. -- tentative tom in tampa
### Answer:
Dear Tentative Tom,

There's no one-size-fits-all answer to your question, as it depends on personal comfort levels and mutual consent. The key is open communication with your date about expectations and boundaries. As for calling, it's not about gender roles but about expressing genuine interest. If you enjoyed the date, a simple message or call the next day to say so is perfectly fine. It's not needy, it's considerate. Remember, honesty and respect never go out of style. 

Best,
Abby

### Question:
i do online dating. for safety, i use an alias. i look much younger than my 43 years, so i went out with a 29-year-old who thinks i'm 33. i have horrible luck with relationships and didn't think this one would be any different. boy, was i wrong! we have been dating three weeks now. how do i tell him i'm 43, have two kids he doesn't know about and a different name? or should i just break it off now? -- incognito in mississippi
### Answer:
Dear Incognito in Mississippi,

Honesty is the foundation of any strong relationship. It's time to come clean. Explain why you used an alias and didn't disclose your age or children initially. If he's as wonderful as you believe, he'll understand your caution. If he doesn't, then he may not be the one for you. Remember, any relationship built on deception is like a house built on sand. It won't stand the test of time. Good luck!

### Question:
how do you attract single women while on a budget? -- gary in longwood, fla.
### Answer:
Dear Gary,

Attracting a woman doesn't require a hefty bank account, but rather a rich character. Show genuine interest in her, listen attentively, and be kind. Plan thoughtful, budget-friendly dates like picnics, museum visits, or walks in the park. Remember, it's the quality of time spent together, not the quantity of money spent, that truly matters. 

Abby

### Question:
how do you respond if you're dating a much older man and someone asks if he is your father? -- the younger woman in vero beach, fla.
### Answer:
Dear Younger Woman,

Respond with grace and a touch of humor. You might say, "No, he's not my father, but he's certainly the gentleman I've chosen to date. Isn't he handsome?" Remember, it's your happiness that matters, not the opinions of others. -- Abby

### Question:
is there such a thing as "real love"? you know, the kind where you never feel complete unless your partner is there? i read books about this kind of love. i see movies about it and hear songs, but i have never experienced it. i am not a teen-ager, abby. i am 47 years old and wonder if i have missed out. -- wondering in iowa
### Answer:
Dear Wondering in Iowa,

Real love does exist, but it's not about feeling incomplete without your partner. It's about feeling more complete with them. It's a partnership, a companionship, and a mutual respect and understanding. It's not about needing someone to fill a void, but about sharing your life with someone who enhances it. You haven't missed out. Love can happen at any age, and it's never too late to experience it. Keep your heart open and remember, the best love stories are those that happen when you least expect them.

### Question:
i am a divorced woman with one child, and i'm in a relationship with a younger man. he has his own home, and i have mine. he stays at my house three nights a week and every other weekend, when my child is not with me. he eats and grooms himself in my home and swims in the community pool. he never offers to pay for anything, like food, movie tickets, etc. if we go out, he expects me to pay my own way. in today's world is there any responsibility on a man in a relationship to pay for anything other than himself? are the days of men taking women out and paying for the date gone? shouldn't he offer to bring groceries during the times he spends at my home? what should a lady expect from a man in a dating relationship? -- gal in virginia
### Answer:
Dear Gal in Virginia,

In today's world, the expectation isn't necessarily that the man pays for everything, but rather that both parties contribute to the relationship in a fair and balanced way. It's not about gender, but about respect and consideration. If your gentleman friend is regularly eating and grooming at your home, it would be courteous of him to contribute to groceries or household expenses. It's not unreasonable to expect him to pay his own way when you go out, but he should also occasionally treat you, just as you might treat him. It's all about balance. If you're feeling taken advantage of, it's important to communicate your feelings to him. Remember, a relationship is a partnership, and both parties should feel valued and respected. -- Abby
