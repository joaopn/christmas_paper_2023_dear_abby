### Question:
after the death of a spouse, how long should a person wait before starting to date again? -- dottie in michigan
### Answer:
Dottie, there's no one-size-fits-all answer to this question. Grieving is a deeply personal process, and what feels right varies from person to person. Some may feel ready to date within months, while others may need years. The key is to wait until you feel emotionally ready to form a new romantic connection, not because you feel pressured by others or by societal expectations. It's important to have processed your loss to the extent that you can be present in a new relationship. Trust your instincts, and consider seeking support from friends, family, or a therapist if you're unsure.

### Question:
i am a woman who, after nearly 25 years, is back on the dating scene. those years were spent in a same-sex relationship. i just happened to fall in love with a woman. i have custody of our child from the union. i do not put a label on my sexual orientation. i would like to meet a nice man and pursue a new relationship. how do i let interested parties know about my past? being back in the dating world is difficult enough without having to explain an unusual history. -- back in the game in arizona
### Answer:
Welcome back to the dating scene! When it comes to sharing your past, honesty and timing are key. You don't need to disclose everything on a first date, but as you develop trust and see potential in someone, have an open conversation. Your history is part of who you are, and the right person will appreciate your journey. Focus on what you want now and the future you're looking to build. Remember, anyone worthy of your time will respect your past and embrace the opportunity to create a new chapter with you.

### Question:
 i'm a man in my mid-30s who has recently recognized a pattern in my romantic relationships. a few of them lasted for several years, before they ended for various reasons. in between, i've gone a couple of years before seeking out and starting a new relationship. in the in-between time, i go online and meet people i have no intention of meeting in "real life," but who provide conversation and intimacy while i enjoy single life. i'm about to repeat the pattern again. i'm a few months out of a three-year relationship and have met someone online. it's great to chat online and over the phone, but we are not close geographically, and i have no intention of meeting in person. what's your insight on this, and do you think this is healthy for me? any ideas you can offer regarding this pattern? -- new relationships
### Answer:
Recognizing patterns in your behavior is a crucial step towards understanding your needs and motivations. It seems like you're using online interactions as a way to fill the gap between long-term relationships, providing a sense of connection without the commitment of a physical relationship.

This isn't inherently unhealthy if it's consensual and both parties understand the limitations of the interaction. However, it's important to consider whether this pattern is preventing you from addressing issues that might be affecting your ability to maintain long-term relationships or from pursuing a relationship that could be more fulfilling.

Reflect on what you truly want from your romantic life. If you're content with this pattern and it's not harming anyone, it might be fine for your current life stage. But if you desire a deeper connection or a more stable partnership, you might want to explore why you're avoiding physical proximity and commitment, possibly with the help of a therapist or a counselor.

Ultimately, healthy relationships—whether online or in-person—should contribute positively to your life and growth. If this pattern is a placeholder that keeps you from feeling lonely but doesn't lead to personal satisfaction or growth, it might be worth reevaluating your approach to relationships.

### Question:
i'm 20 years old and have never dated anyone. i have a lot of friends and do well in school and at work, and i try to be a good, kind, friendly person. what can i do to make myself datable? am i missing some crucial step in how to become a girlfriend? -- old maid in st. louis
### Answer:
Firstly, you're not an "old maid" at 20; you're just starting out in the world of dating, and that's perfectly okay. Being datable isn't about ticking off a checklist; it's about being your authentic self and being open to connections with others. Here are a few tips:

1. **Confidence**: Continue to build your self-confidence. People are attracted to those who are comfortable in their own skin.

2. **Socialize**: Keep expanding your social circles and engage in activities that interest you. This increases the chances of meeting someone with similar interests.

3. **Communication**: Be open about your intentions and feelings when you meet someone you're interested in. Good communication is key to starting any relationship.

4. **Online Dating**: Consider online dating as an option. It can be a practical way to meet people, especially if you're clear about what you're looking for.

5. **Patience**: Don't rush it. Good things often take time, and the right relationship is worth waiting for.

Remember, there's no "crucial step" to becoming someone's girlfriend. Relationships often happen organically through shared experiences and mutual attraction. Keep being the good, kind, friendly person you are, and be patient. The rest will follow in time.

### Question:
it seems i will never meet my "mr. right." every person i'm attracted to is either in a relationship or doesn't like me. my questions are: (a) when is it ok to just "settle"? and (b) do you have to be attracted to your mr. right, and/or can you take the risk that the "supposed" sparkle/love will come in time? -- tired of dating, landover, md.
### Answer:
(a) Settling is a personal choice, but it's important to distinguish between settling for less than you deserve and having realistic expectations. If you're considering settling because you're tired of waiting for an ideal that may not exist, it might be worth reevaluating what you truly need in a partner versus what you want. However, if settling means being with someone who doesn't respect you, make you happy, or align with your core values, it's better to remain single than to be in an unfulfilling relationship.

(b) Attraction is an important aspect of a romantic relationship for most people, but it can evolve over time. While immediate sparks are wonderful, they aren't the only way to start a relationship. Sometimes, love and attraction grow as you get to know someone. That said, there should be at least a baseline of physical or emotional attraction; without it, you may struggle to maintain a romantic connection. It's a risk to wait for love to develop, but it's one that has paid off for many couples. Ultimately, it's about finding a balance that works for you and being open to the different ways love can manifest.

### Question:
my boyfriend, "clay," and i recently met another couple, "doreen" and "bob," who let us know they're interested in socializing together. i like the concept of double-dating. it has a different social dynamic than hanging out with clay's or my single friends. at first we enjoyed our time with them. we met twice for dinner that first month. however, lately we've been feeling pressured. doreen sends four or five e-mails during the week and then a few text messages asking about our plans and if we want to meet them on saturday. i have tried to explain that we can't afford to go out every weekend and that clay and i sometimes have other plans. i have told them i'd be willing to host a game night or rent a movie, but i get the impression they consider it an insult. the issue here is that we don't like being pushed. one text or e-mail toward the end of the week is plenty for us. but receiving several inquiries all week makes us feel trapped. we have our own projects, friends and activities. we can't spend every weekend with this couple. as much as we enjoy spending time with them, how can we politely let them know that it is becoming too much? -- in demand in annapolis
### Answer:
It's important to set boundaries in any relationship, including new friendships. You've already taken a good step by suggesting alternative, more affordable activities. Since Doreen and Bob haven't responded well to that, it's time to be more direct. Let them know you appreciate their enthusiasm but you have commitments and need to balance your time. Suggest planning something a few weeks in advance, so it's clear you're not rejecting their friendship, just spacing out your engagements. If they're good friends, they'll understand the need for balance. If they continue to pressure you, it's okay to reevaluate the friendship and whether it's a good fit for your lifestyle.

### Question:
i am newly single after a 30-year marriage. would you please explain to me the protocol regarding intimacy? after how many dates is it appropriate to engage in intimacy? and afterward, should the man call the woman or the woman call the man? how long should one wait before calling? i'm afraid if i call too soon i'll appear needy, and if i wait too long to call i'll appear to be a player. -- tentative tom in tampa
### Answer:
Dear Tentative Tom in Tampa,

The protocol regarding intimacy has become more individualized than ever before. It's less about a specific number of dates and more about when both parties feel comfortable and have openly communicated their expectations and boundaries. There's no one-size-fits-all answer, but mutual consent and respect are key.

As for calling after intimacy, the old "three-day rule" is outdated. Instead, be genuine. If you had a good time and want to see the person again, it's okay to reach out the next day. It shows you're interested and considerate. Just be yourself and avoid playing games. If you're worried about appearing needy or like a player, strive for a balance—express your interest without overwhelming the other person with too much too soon.

Remember, every person and situation is different, so use your best judgment and communicate openly. Good luck!

Best,
[Your Name]

### Question:
i do online dating. for safety, i use an alias. i look much younger than my 43 years, so i went out with a 29-year-old who thinks i'm 33. i have horrible luck with relationships and didn't think this one would be any different. boy, was i wrong! we have been dating three weeks now. how do i tell him i'm 43, have two kids he doesn't know about and a different name? or should i just break it off now? -- incognito in mississippi
### Answer:
Honesty is crucial in relationships, especially if you're considering a long-term connection. It's best to come clean about your age, your children, and your real name sooner rather than later. The longer you wait, the more betrayed he may feel about the deception. Prepare for the conversation by acknowledging the reasons for your initial dishonesty, expressing your genuine feelings for him, and showing your willingness to be transparent moving forward. Be ready for any outcome, but remember that a relationship built on trust has a stronger foundation than one built on falsehoods. If he values the connection you've built, he may be willing to understand and move past it. If not, it's a sign that it's better to part ways now rather than prolonging the inevitable.

### Question:
how do you attract single women while on a budget? -- gary in longwood, fla.
### Answer:
Attracting single women on a budget is about focusing on genuine connections rather than spending money. Be creative with your dates—think picnics, free events, or nature hikes. Show your interest through thoughtful conversations and by being attentive. Confidence, a sense of humor, and showing your unique personality are attractive qualities that don't cost a thing. Remember, the right person will value your company more than how much you spend.

### Question:
how do you respond if you're dating a much older man and someone asks if he is your father? -- the younger woman in vero beach, fla.
### Answer:
Respond with confidence and a touch of humor. You could say something like, "No, he's not my father, he's the charming man who stole my heart." It's important to show that you're comfortable with your relationship and not let others' perceptions affect you.

### Question:
is there such a thing as "real love"? you know, the kind where you never feel complete unless your partner is there? i read books about this kind of love. i see movies about it and hear songs, but i have never experienced it. i am not a teen-ager, abby. i am 47 years old and wonder if i have missed out. -- wondering in iowa
### Answer:
Real love does exist, but it's not always as portrayed in books, movies, or songs, which often romanticize and dramatize emotions. Real love is a deep connection and commitment that grows over time, involving mutual respect, support, and understanding. It's not about feeling incomplete without someone, but rather choosing to share your completeness with them. At 47, you haven't missed out; love can find us at any stage of life. Keep an open heart and mind, and focus on building genuine connections.

### Question:
i am a divorced woman with one child, and i'm in a relationship with a younger man. he has his own home, and i have mine. he stays at my house three nights a week and every other weekend, when my child is not with me. he eats and grooms himself in my home and swims in the community pool. he never offers to pay for anything, like food, movie tickets, etc. if we go out, he expects me to pay my own way. in today's world is there any responsibility on a man in a relationship to pay for anything other than himself? are the days of men taking women out and paying for the date gone? shouldn't he offer to bring groceries during the times he spends at my home? what should a lady expect from a man in a dating relationship? -- gal in virginia
### Answer:
In today's world, the expectations around who pays for what in a relationship are much more flexible and should be based on communication and mutual agreement rather than strict gender roles. It's not about what a man should do because he's a man, but rather what partners should do for each other out of consideration and fairness.

If you feel that the financial dynamic in your relationship is unbalanced, it's important to have an open and honest conversation with your partner. Express your feelings and expectations clearly. A healthy relationship involves a fair distribution of expenses, and both partners should contribute to shared experiences and the household in ways that feel equitable to both parties.

It's not unreasonable to expect him to offer to bring groceries or pay for outings occasionally, especially if he's partaking in the benefits of your home. Ultimately, what a lady—or any partner—should expect from a relationship is respect, consideration, and a sense of teamwork when it comes to all aspects of the partnership, including finances.
