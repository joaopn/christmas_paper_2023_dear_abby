### Question:
after the death of a spouse, how long should a person wait before starting to date again? -- dottie in michigan
### Answer:


Dear Dottie,

The timeline for starting to date after the loss of a spouse is highly personal and varies from individual to individual. Some people may feel ready to explore new relationships soon after their partner's passing, while others may need more time to grieve and heal. It's essential to honor your own feelings and needs in this process.

That being said, it's generally recommended that individuals wait a significant amount of time before jumping into a new relationship. This can help ensure that they are truly ready for a new partnership and have given themselves ample time to grieve and process their emotions. A year or two is often suggested as a reasonable waiting period, but ultimately, the decision should be based on what feels right for you.

Remember, healing from grief is a journey, and everyone's path will look different. Be kind to yourself and take things at your own pace. If you have any doubts or concerns about starting to date again, it may be helpful to seek the guidance of a trusted therapist or counselor. They can provide additional support and perspective as you navigate this new chapter in your life.

With compassionate care,
[YOUR NAME]

### Question:
i am a woman who, after nearly 25 years, is back on the dating scene. those years were spent in a same-sex relationship. i just happened to fall in love with a woman. i have custody of our child from the union. i do not put a label on my sexual orientation. i would like to meet a nice man and pursue a new relationship. how do i let interested parties know about my past? being back in the dating world is difficult enough without having to explain an unusual history. -- back in the game in arizona
### Answer:


Dear Back in the Game,

It's understandable that you're hesitant to share your entire history with every potential partner. However, it's also important to be honest and upfront about your past relationships, especially if they involve children. Here are a few suggestions:

1. Be clear about your current relationship status: Let people know that you're divorced or legally separated from your former partner, and that you have custody of your child. This will help potential partners understand where you stand and what kind of commitment you're looking for.

2. Address the elephant in the room: If you've been out of the dating scene for a long time, it might be helpful to acknowledge that fact and explain why. For example, you could say something like, "I know it's been a while since I've dated, but I'm back in the game now and looking for someone special."

3. Keep it brief: You don't need to go into great detail about your past relationships or explain every aspect of your sexual orientation. Just provide enough information to give potential partners a basic understanding of your history.

4. Focus on the present: Instead of dwelling on the past, try to focus on the here and now. Talk about your interests, hobbies, and goals for the future. This will help potential partners get to know you as a person, rather than just as someone with an unusual history.

5. Trust your instincts: Ultimately, you'll need to decide how much information to share based on your own comfort level and the specific circumstances of each relationship. If you feel like someone is being judgmental or insensitive, it might be best to move on rather than trying to explain everything. But if you sense that someone is open-minded and accepting, then by all means, share your story!

Remember, everyone has their own unique history, and there's no such thing as a "normal" dating experience. The most important thing is to be true to yourself and find someone who appreciates and respects you for who you are. Good luck!

### Question:
 i'm a man in my mid-30s who has recently recognized a pattern in my romantic relationships. a few of them lasted for several years, before they ended for various reasons. in between, i've gone a couple of years before seeking out and starting a new relationship. in the in-between time, i go online and meet people i have no intention of meeting in "real life," but who provide conversation and intimacy while i enjoy single life. i'm about to repeat the pattern again. i'm a few months out of a three-year relationship and have met someone online. it's great to chat online and over the phone, but we are not close geographically, and i have no intention of meeting in person. what's your insight on this, and do you think this is healthy for me? any ideas you can offer regarding this pattern? -- new relationships
### Answer:


Dear New Relationships,

Your pattern of seeking out online connections during the in-between phases of longer relationships may provide temporary comfort and companionship, but it could also be hindering your ability to fully move on and heal from past relationships. While there's nothing inherently wrong with online dating or casual chats, it's important to strike a balance between virtual connections and real-life experiences.

Here are some insights and ideas:

1. Allow yourself time to process and heal: It's natural to feel lonely or disconnected after a long-term relationship ends, but rushing into another relationship may prevent you from fully processing your emotions and learning from the past. Instead, focus on self-care activities like exercise, therapy, or hobbies that bring you joy.

2. Practice honesty and transparency: If you do decide to pursue an online connection, be upfront about your current situation and any potential roadblocks (such as distance). Honesty will help build trust and prevent misunderstandings down the line.

3. Consider the long-term implications: While it's tempting to fill the void with constant distractions, this pattern may also indicate a deeper issue like fear of being alone or low self-esteem. Take some time to reflect on your motivations and whether these online connections are truly serving your needs.

4. Prioritize quality over quantity: Instead of spreading yourself thin across multiple online relationships, focus on cultivating deeper connections with a select few. This will allow you to invest more time and energy into each relationship and potentially lead to more meaningful outcomes.

5. Trust your instincts: Ultimately, the decision to pursue an online connection or wait for something more concrete is up to you. Listen to your gut and trust that you'll make the right choice for your own well-being.

Remember, there's no one "right" way to navigate relationships, but finding a balance between virtual connections and real-life experiences can lead to greater fulfillment and happiness in the long run. Best of luck!

### Question:
i'm 20 years old and have never dated anyone. i have a lot of friends and do well in school and at work, and i try to be a good, kind, friendly person. what can i do to make myself datable? am i missing some crucial step in how to become a girlfriend? -- old maid in st. louis
### Answer:


Dear Old Maid in St. Louis,

While the term "old maid" may have been used in a different context decades ago, it's clear that you're feeling a bit unsure about your dating prospects. Here are some suggestions to help you become more datable:

1. Be confident: Believe in yourself and your worth as a person. Don't wait for someone else to validate you or make you feel attractive. You already have those qualities, so let them shine through.

2. Put yourself out there: Join clubs, attend events, and meet new people. Don't be afraid to strike up a conversation with someone you find interesting. The more you put yourself in social situations, the greater your chances of meeting someone special.

3. Practice good communication skills: Listen actively, ask questions, and show genuine interest in what others have to say. This will help you connect with potential partners on a deeper level.

4. Take care of yourself: Eat well, exercise regularly, and get enough sleep. When you feel good about your physical health, it will reflect in your confidence and self-esteem.

5. Be open-minded: Don't limit yourself to a certain type of person or relationship. Keep an open mind and be willing to explore different options. You never know who might surprise you.

6. Learn to compromise: Relationships require give and take. Be willing to make sacrifices for the sake of your partner, but also communicate your own needs and boundaries.

7. Practice good manners: Treat others with kindness, respect, and courtesy. This will help you build positive relationships and attract potential partners.

Remember, becoming datable is a process that takes time and effort. Don't be too hard on yourself if things don't happen overnight. Keep working on yourself, and the right person will come along when the time is right. Good luck!

### Question:
it seems i will never meet my "mr. right." every person i'm attracted to is either in a relationship or doesn't like me. my questions are: (a) when is it ok to just "settle"? and (b) do you have to be attracted to your mr. right, and/or can you take the risk that the "supposed" sparkle/love will come in time? -- tired of dating, landover, md.
### Answer:


Dear Tired:

(A) It's never OK to settle for less than you deserve. Relationships are too important to your happiness and well-being to accept anything less than the real thing.

(B) Yes, you should be attracted to your Mr. Right. However, sometimes people grow more attractive to us as we get to know them better. Chemistry can develop over time. That being said, it's important not to ignore red flags or settle for someone who doesn't make you feel good about yourself.

Remember, love is a journey, not a destination. It takes patience, persistence, and an open heart. Keep your eyes and mind open, and trust that the right person will come along when the time is right. In the meantime, focus on being the best version of yourself and enjoying all that life has to offer.

### Question:
my boyfriend, "clay," and i recently met another couple, "doreen" and "bob," who let us know they're interested in socializing together. i like the concept of double-dating. it has a different social dynamic than hanging out with clay's or my single friends. at first we enjoyed our time with them. we met twice for dinner that first month. however, lately we've been feeling pressured. doreen sends four or five e-mails during the week and then a few text messages asking about our plans and if we want to meet them on saturday. i have tried to explain that we can't afford to go out every weekend and that clay and i sometimes have other plans. i have told them i'd be willing to host a game night or rent a movie, but i get the impression they consider it an insult. the issue here is that we don't like being pushed. one text or e-mail toward the end of the week is plenty for us. but receiving several inquiries all week makes us feel trapped. we have our own projects, friends and activities. we can't spend every weekend with this couple. as much as we enjoy spending time with them, how can we politely let them know that it is becoming too much? -- in demand in annapolis
### Answer:


Dear In Demand:
You need to have a frank conversation with Doreen and Bob. Explain that you appreciate their company but feel pressured by the constant communication. Let them know that while you enjoy double-dating, you also value your independence and need some space. Suggest alternative ways to socialize, such as hosting game nights or movie nights at your home. Be clear and polite, but firm in setting boundaries. Remember, it's okay to say no without feeling guilty. Good luck!

### Question:
i am newly single after a 30-year marriage. would you please explain to me the protocol regarding intimacy? after how many dates is it appropriate to engage in intimacy? and afterward, should the man call the woman or the woman call the man? how long should one wait before calling? i'm afraid if i call too soon i'll appear needy, and if i wait too long to call i'll appear to be a player. -- tentative tom in tampa
### Answer:


Dear Tentative Tom,

Intimacy is a personal decision that should be made by both partners based on their comfort level and the nature of the relationship. There is no set timeline for when it's appropriate to engage in intimacy. Some couples may feel ready after just a few dates, while others prefer to wait longer. It's essential to communicate openly and honestly with your partner about your feelings and expectations regarding intimacy.

After intimacy, the man should call the woman first. This shows that he values her and respects her feelings. However, there is no hard and fast rule about how long one should wait before calling. It's best to err on the side of caution and wait at least a day or two before reaching out. This gives both partners time to process their emotions and avoid any misunderstandings.

Remember, the goal is to find a balance between showing interest and avoiding neediness. If you feel like you're calling too soon, try waiting an extra day or two before making contact. And if you're worried about coming across as a player, make sure to follow through on your promises and treat your partner with respect and kindness.

Best wishes for your new journey!

-- Abigail Van Buren (Dear Abby)

### Question:

### Answer:


Dear Incognito,

It's time to come clean. Keeping secrets like this can lead to bigger problems down the road. It's better to be upfront and honest from the start, even if it means potentially ending things sooner. Explain that you've been using an alias for safety reasons and that you're actually older than you initially let on. Be prepared for his reaction, but remember that honesty is always the best policy. If he can't accept you for who you truly are, then it may be best to move on. Good luck!

### Question:
how do you attract single women while on a budget? -- gary in longwood, fla.
### Answer:


Dear Gary,

To attract single women without breaking the bank, here are some tips:

1. Be yourself: Women appreciate authenticity and sincerity. Don't try to be someone you're not just to impress a potential partner.

2. Smile and make eye contact: A genuine smile and direct gaze can go a long way in catching a woman's attention. It shows that you're confident and approachable.

3. Join social groups or clubs: This is an excellent way to meet like-minded people who share your interests. You could join a book club, hiking group, or volunteer organization.

4. Attend free events: Many cities offer free concerts, festivals, and cultural events. Check out the local listings and attend these gatherings to meet new people.

5. Be a good listener: Women appreciate men who listen attentively and show genuine interest in what they have to say. Practice active listening skills by maintaining eye contact, nodding, and asking follow-up questions.

6. Compliment her: A sincere compliment can go a long way in making a woman feel appreciated. Just be sure to keep it appropriate and avoid being overly flirtatious or creepy.

7. Show kindness and respect: Treat women with kindness, respect, and courtesy. This will help you stand out from the crowd and make a positive impression.

Remember, attracting single women is not just about spending money on expensive dates or gifts. It's more about being genuine, authentic, and treating others with kindness and respect. Good luck!

### Question:
how do you respond if you're dating a much older man and someone asks if he is your father? -- the younger woman in vero beach, fla.
### Answer:


Dear Younger Woman,

When someone asks if your older boyfriend is your father, it can be an awkward and uncomfortable situation. Here's how you might respond:

1. Laugh politely and say something like, "No, thank goodness! He's actually much younger than he looks." This lighthearted response will diffuse the tension and show that you're not offended by the question.

2. If you prefer a more straightforward answer, simply say, "No, we're dating. Why do you ask?" This direct approach shows confidence and clarity in your relationship status.

3. You could also use humor to deflect the question. For example, "Well, he's old enough to be my father, but I prefer to think of him as my sugar daddy." This response adds a touch of levity to the situation and shows that you're not taking the question too seriously.

Remember, how you respond will depend on your personal style and comfort level. The most important thing is to remain calm, composed, and confident in your answer. Good luck!

### Question:
is there such a thing as "real love"? you know, the kind where you never feel complete unless your partner is there? i read books about this kind of love. i see movies about it and hear songs, but i have never experienced it. i am not a teen-ager, abby. i am 47 years old and wonder if i have missed out. -- wondering in iowa
### Answer:
Dear Wondering: Yes, there is such a thing as "real love," and it's never too late to experience it. Real love isn't about age or stage of life; it's about finding someone who completes you and makes your heart sing. It's about respect, trust, communication, compromise and commitment. It's about being there for each other through thick and thin, and about growing and evolving together. If you haven't found this kind of love yet, don't give up hope. Keep your eyes and heart open, and keep putting yourself out there. You never know when or where you might meet someone special. And remember, it's never too late to start over and create a new chapter in your life. Best wishes on your journey!

### Question:
i am a divorced woman with one child, and i'm in a relationship with a younger man. he has his own home, and i have mine. he stays at my house three nights a week and every other weekend, when my child is not with me. he eats and grooms himself in my home and swims in the community pool. he never offers to pay for anything, like food, movie tickets, etc. if we go out, he expects me to pay my own way. in today's world is there any responsibility on a man in a relationship to pay for anything other than himself? are the days of men taking women out and paying for the date gone? shouldn't he offer to bring groceries during the times he spends at my home? what should a lady expect from a man in a dating relationship? -- gal in virginia
### Answer:


Dear Gal,

In today's world, it's not uncommon for couples to share expenses based on their individual circumstances. However, there are still some traditional expectations when it comes to dating and relationships. In your situation, since your partner spends several nights a week at your home and uses your resources, it would be appropriate for him to contribute in some way. This could include bringing groceries or offering to pay for meals or activities when you go out together. While it's true that women are more financially independent than ever before, there is still value in the gesture of a man treating his partner to dinner or an event as a sign of respect and affection. Ultimately, communication and compromise are key in any relationship. If your partner is unwilling to contribute more, you may need to have an honest conversation about your expectations and come to a mutual agreement that works for both of you. Remember, the most important thing is that you're both happy and comfortable with the arrangement.
