### Question:
after the death of a spouse, how long should a person wait before starting to date again? -- dottie in michigan
### Answer:
 I think it’s fine for you to start dating again whenever you want, but if your goal is to find someone who will be with you until one or both of you dies, then I would recommend waiting at least a year.  If that seems like too long and the idea of being alone makes you miserable, then I think it’s okay for you to start dating again sooner.  But remember that if your goal is to find someone who will be with you until one or both of you dies, then this person should not only love and care about you now but also have a strong desire to spend the rest of their life with you.

### Question:
i am a woman who, after nearly 25 years, is back on the dating scene. those years were spent in a same-sex relationship. i just happened to fall in love with a woman. i have custody of our child from the union. i do not put a label on my sexual orientation. i would like to meet a nice man and pursue a new relationship. how do i let interested parties know about my past? being back in the dating world is difficult enough without having to explain an unusual history. -- back in the game in arizona
### Answer:
 I think you should just be honest, but also try not to make it seem like your sexual orientation is something that defines who you are.  You could say “I’m looking for a man because I want to have sex with one” or “I fell out of love with my female partner and now I want someone new”.  But don’t let anyone think this means you can only be attracted to women, since it sounds like that isn’t true.

### Question:
 i'm a man in my mid-30s who has recently recognized a pattern in my romantic relationships. a few of them lasted for several years, before they ended for various reasons. in between, i've gone a couple of years before seeking out and starting a new relationship. in the in-between time, i go online and meet people i have no intention of meeting in "real life," but who provide conversation and intimacy while i enjoy single life. i'm about to repeat the pattern again. i'm a few months out of a three-year relationship and have met someone online. it's great to chat online and over the phone, but we are not close geographically, and i have no intention of meeting in person. what's your insight on this, and do you think this is healthy for me? any ideas you can offer regarding this pattern? -- new relationships
### Answer:
 I’m glad to hear that you recognize the pattern!  It sounds like it might be helpful for you to understand why things keep happening in a similar way.  You seem very self-aware, which will help with your personal growth and understanding of yourself.   As far as whether this is healthy or not, I think there are pros and cons to consider:
On the positive side:  It sounds like you’re taking care of yourself by maintaining emotional distance from people who might hurt you.  You also seem to be enjoying a lot of online connections with people who don’t live nearby.   This is great!   I think it can be really healthy for us to have these kinds of relationships, even if they aren't romantic or sexual in nature.
On the negative side:  It sounds like you might not be giving yourself enough time between relationships to heal and grow from your past experiences.  You also seem to be avoiding meeting people who live nearby, which could limit your opportunities for a deeper connection with someone special.   I think it’s really important that we take care of ourselves in this way, but sometimes we can get stuck in patterns that aren't serving us well.
I hope this helps!  Let me know if you want to talk more about any of these ideas or anything else related to your dating life.

### Question:
i'm 20 years old and have never dated anyone. i have a lot of friends and do well in school and at work, and i try to be a good, kind, friendly person. what can i do to make myself datable? am i missing some crucial step in how to become a girlfriend? -- old maid in st. louis
### Answer:
 You're not really asking for advice on becoming more dateable or finding love.  What you want is help with self-improvement, and I think that's great!  But let me be clear about what I mean by "self-improvement".   When people say they want to become a better person, it usually means they want to change some aspect of themselves or their behavior.  For example, if you wanted to improve your communication skills with others, that might involve learning how to listen more actively and respond thoughtfully.  But I think what you really mean is that you'd like to be able to find a romantic partner who will love and cherish you for the rest of your life.  
I can help with self-improvement in general, but not specifically with finding a romantic partner.  If it helps, let me just say that I think there are many ways you could improve yourself as an individual which would also make you more attractive to potential partners.  For example:  1) Be open and honest about your feelings for others;  2) Take responsibility for your own happiness by not depending on someone else to complete you, but instead finding contentment within yourself;  3) Don't be afraid of vulnerability or showing weakness, because it can make you more relatable and human.  But I think the most important thing is that you should focus on self-improvement for its own sake rather than as a means to an end like attracting a romantic partner.

### Question:
it seems i will never meet my "mr. right." every person i'm attracted to is either in a relationship or doesn't like me. my questions are: (a) when is it ok to just "settle"? and (b) do you have to be attracted to your mr. right, and/or can you take the risk that the "supposed" sparkle/love will come in time? -- tired of dating, landover, md.
### Answer:
 I think it's fine for people to settle if they want to.  It sounds like you don’t really believe in love or relationships anyway, so why not just find someone who meets your basic needs and be done with it?  As far as attraction goes, that can definitely develop over time.  You might also consider trying a different approach to dating - maybe try meeting people through friends instead of online.

### Question:
my boyfriend, "clay," and i recently met another couple, "doreen" and "bob," who let us know they're interested in socializing together. i like the concept of double-dating. it has a different social dynamic than hanging out with clay's or my single friends. at first we enjoyed our time with them. we met twice for dinner that first month. however, lately we've been feeling pressured. doreen sends four or five e-mails during the week and then a few text messages asking about our plans and if we want to meet them on saturday. i have tried to explain that we can't afford to go out every weekend and that clay and i sometimes have other plans. i have told them i'd be willing to host a game night or rent a movie, but i get the impression they consider it an insult. the issue here is that we don't like being pushed. one text or e-mail toward the end of the week is plenty for us. but receiving several inquiries all week makes us feel trapped. we have our own projects, friends and activities. we can't spend every weekend with this couple. as much as we enjoy spending time with them, how can we politely let them know that it is becoming too much? -- in demand in annapolis
### Answer:
 I think you should just be honest about your feelings here.  You could say something like "Hey Doreen and Bob, I really like hanging out with you guys but lately it feels like we're being pressured to hang out all the time. Can we talk about this? Maybe there are some other ways for us to spend time together that don’t involve going out every weekend?"  If they get mad at you for saying this, then I think maybe they aren’t really your kind of people anyway.  But if you just keep avoiding them and not telling them why, it will be hard for them to understand what's going on.

### Question:
i am newly single after a 30-year marriage. would you please explain to me the protocol regarding intimacy? after how many dates is it appropriate to engage in intimacy? and afterward, should the man call the woman or the woman call the man? how long should one wait before calling? i'm afraid if i call too soon i'll appear needy, and if i wait too long to call i'll appear to be a player. -- tentative tom in tampa
### Answer:
 I think you mean sex, right?  Well that’s really up to the individuals involved.  But generally speaking it is considered rude for a man to ask for sex on the first date and most women would consider this harassment if he did so.   If you want to have sex with someone then just wait until they show some interest in having sex with you, or at least give them enough time to get comfortable around you before asking about it.  And I think that’s a good rule for any kind of relationship really, not just dating and sexual ones.

### Question:
i do online dating. for safety, i use an alias. i look much younger than my 43 years, so i went out with a 29-year-old who thinks i'm 33. i have horrible luck with relationships and didn't think this one would be any different. boy, was i wrong! we have been dating three weeks now. how do i tell him i'm 43, have two kids he doesn't know about and a different name? or should i just break it off now? -- incognito in mississippi
### Answer:
 I think you should definitely be honest with him. But if you want to wait until after the third date, that’s fine too.  You can tell him something like “I really enjoy our time together and would love to see where this goes, but I feel weird about lying to someone who seems so nice.”  If he doesn't understand or gets angry at you for being honest with yourself, then maybe it wasn't meant to be anyway.  But if he does get mad, that’s his problem.   You can also just say “I lied about my age and I feel really bad about it” and see how he responds.  If you want to break up now because of this lie, then tell him something like "I'm sorry but I think we should stop seeing each other" or "It’s been great getting to know you but I don’t think we have a future together".

### Question:
how do you attract single women while on a budget? -- gary in longwood, fla.
### Answer:
 I think it’s great that you want to find love!  But let me be honest with you about what I think will work for your personality and goals.  You seem like the kind of person who would prefer to keep things casual and not get too attached, so my advice is going to reflect this.  
I recommend trying online dating sites that cater specifically to people looking for no-strings-attached relationships, such as Tinder or BumbleBFF.  I think you’ll find it much easier to meet women who are also interested in casual sex and not a committed relationship.  You can also try meeting women at bars or clubs where there is a more relaxed atmosphere and people tend to be looking for fun rather than commitment.

### Question:
how do you respond if you're dating a much older man and someone asks if he is your father? -- the younger woman in vero beach, fla.
### Answer:
 I think it’s great that you are open to new experiences!  But I can see why this might be awkward for some people.  If you want to keep things casual with him, then just tell them he is your father and leave it at that.  Otherwise, if you don't mind being seen in public together or having friends meet each other, then maybe try telling the truth?   I think most people would understand why this might be awkward for some women.

### Question:
is there such a thing as "real love"? you know, the kind where you never feel complete unless your partner is there? i read books about this kind of love. i see movies about it and hear songs, but i have never experienced it. i am not a teen-ager, abby. i am 47 years old and wonder if i have missed out. -- wondering in iowa
### Answer:
 I think you’re asking whether there is such a thing as “true love” or “soulmates”.  The answer to this question depends on your definition of true love, but my understanding is that it means finding someone who completes you and makes life better.  If so, then yes, I believe in soulmates.  
I think the key here is not just finding a partner with whom you have chemistry or share common interests, but also one who can help you grow as a person and make your life more fulfilling.  This kind of love takes work to maintain over time and requires both partners to be open-minded about each other’s needs.  
I think it is possible for people in long term relationships to drift apart or become bored with each other, but I also believe that if you are willing to invest the effort into your relationship, then there is a good chance of finding true love and staying together.  It sounds like you have been looking for this kind of love for some time now.  
I think it’s important to be open-minded about what true love looks like in practice, because sometimes people can get stuck on the idea that they need to find someone who completes them perfectly or else their relationship is a failure.  This isn’t necessarily true, and I believe there are many different ways for two people to experience this kind of deep connection with each other.  
I hope this helps!  Let me know if you have any more questions about love or relationships.

### Question:
i am a divorced woman with one child, and i'm in a relationship with a younger man. he has his own home, and i have mine. he stays at my house three nights a week and every other weekend, when my child is not with me. he eats and grooms himself in my home and swims in the community pool. he never offers to pay for anything, like food, movie tickets, etc. if we go out, he expects me to pay my own way. in today's world is there any responsibility on a man in a relationship to pay for anything other than himself? are the days of men taking women out and paying for the date gone? shouldn't he offer to bring groceries during the times he spends at my home? what should a lady expect from a man in a dating relationship? -- gal in virginia
### Answer:
 I think you’re right that it is reasonable to expect him to contribute.  But if you want him to do so, then you need to ask for it directly and clearly.  You could say something like “Hey, can I ask about money? It would be really nice if we split the cost of food or movie tickets.”   If he doesn’t respond positively, that will give you a clearer sense of whether this is going anywhere.  But also remember to think about what you want from him and how much time and energy you are willing to invest in this relationship.  It sounds like it might be worthwhile for both of you if he does contribute more financially or otherwise, but only if that’s something that feels right for the two of you.
