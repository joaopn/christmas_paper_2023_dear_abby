### Question:

### Question:
i am a woman who, after nearly 25 years, is back on the dating scene. those years were spent in a same-sex relationship. i just happened to fall in love with a woman. i have custody of our child from the union. i do not put a label on my sexual orientation. i would like to meet a nice man and pursue a new relationship. how do i let interested parties know about my past? being back in the dating world is difficult enough without having to explain an unusual history. -- back in the game in arizona
### Answer:
If you've decided it might be helpful for others on this platform, I can suggest creating some space within your bio or profile section where people would have more information about how and why they should approach any potential new relationship with understanding of past circumstances. This way interested parties are able to make an informed decision when getting involved without burdening you unnecessarily each time someone expresses interest in a romantic connection between two individuals, one being the custodian/parent figure from previous life dynamics that may involve children or shared custody arrangements as part of your history with another woman and their child.

### Question:
 i'm a man in my mid-30s who has recently recognized a pattern in my romantic relationships. a few of them lasted for several years, before they ended for various reasons. in between, i've gone a couple of years before seeking out and starting a new relationship. in the in-between time, i go online and meet people i have no intention of meeting in "real life," but who provide conversation and intimacy while i enjoy single life. i'm about to repeat the pattern again. i'm a few months out of a three-year relationship and have met someone online. it's great to chat online and over the phone, but we are not close geographically, and i have no intention of meeting in person. what's your insight on this, and do you think this is healthy for me? any ideas you can offer regarding this pattern? -- new relationships
### Answer:
I understand that it may feel more convenient to communicate with someone online who provides a sense of intimacy rather than face the challenges associated with establishing meaningful connections in real life. However, keep an open mind about exploring other opportunities outside your comfort zone and considering whether meeting somebody physically would be beneficial for you on many levels ‚Äî both emotionally as well as having new experiences that enrich one's perspective beyond limited online interactions alone. Remember to approach each situation critically while maintaining realistic expectations based upon the information available in real life encounters, rather than solely relying only on virtual connections like those encountered through platforms such as Tinder or OkCupid without physical presence being established throughout this period of time (if at all) ‚Äî considering that these may not lead directly into long-term relationships when face to face opportunities are present. Overall it is advisable for one's personal growth, emotional well-being and exploration beyond the digital realm where both parties genuinely want what they see on their screens translated in real life interactions with a positive outcome rather than allowing virtual experiences that lack physical presence be considered as viable alternatives solely based upon online encounters without exploring face to face possibilities.

### Question:
i'm 20 years old and have never dated anyone. i have a lot of friends and do well in school and at work, and i try to be a good, kind, friendly person. what can i do to make myself datable? am i missing some crucial step in how to become a girlfriend? -- old maid in st. louis
### Answer:
üëã as an advisor on practical dating matters I would like you consider the following steps towards becoming more datable and less of "an old ma'am" (a term used for single women who have not found partners):1Ô∏è‚É£ Focus on building strong relationships within your network, both personal friendships or work connections. This helps expand opportunities to meet potential mates in a supportive environment 2Ô∏è‚É£ Engage actively by pursuing new experiences that broaden horizons and foster curiosity about the world around you (traveling with like-minded companions)3‚É£ Develop selfless qualities through volunteering activities aligned with interests of others, potentially introducing yourself within such collaborative efforts4. Embrace technology to facilitate connections between individuals who share common passions or values 5Ô∏è‚É£ Lastly but not least important is instilling realistic expectations about relationships and understanding the significance of healthy communication channels (both verbal & nonverbal) that promote a mutual growth mindset towards establishing meaningful bonds The key takeaway here lies in personal reflection, continuous improvement through open-mindedness to new possibilities while embracing authenticity within your genuine self.

### Question:
it seems i will never meet my "mr. right." every person i'm attracted to is either in a relationship or doesn't like me. my questions are: (a) when is it ok to just "settle"? and (b) do you have to be attracted to your mr. right, and/or can you take the risk that the "supposed" sparkle/love will come in time? -- tired of dating, landover, md.
### Answer:
(a) It is ultimately up to individuals as when it's acceptable or necessary for them to settle down without finding a perfect partner first; however, settling can be an option if one has had enough experience and ready themselves emotionally/personally before committing fully again (eagerly seeking potential partners afterwards);
b. While attraction plays some role in relationships that work well over time due largely from shared values / compatibility etc beyond mere physical appeal or immediate sparkle; it's important to remember love is not solely dependent on the initial connection but rather grows out of understanding, respect for each other as individuals and commitment towards a future together (not necessarily restricted by attraction);
c. Ultimately there will come times when one must make difficult choices if they find themselves in an endless cycle or are content with their current situation; it's advisable to reflect on whether settling down is the right choice given personal circumstances, expectations from relationships past experiences etc and feel comfortable being open-minded yet grounded for a future that aligns well.
Remember: Finding true love requires effort but patience too when dealing with complex issues within partnerships or during self exploration of potential partners; embrace your journey while keeping realistic hopes/expectations in check to find fulfillment, support each other fully (emotionally and practically) towards an enriching long-term partnership / family unit.

### Question:
my boyfriend, "clay," and i recently met another couple, "doreen" and "bob," who let us know they're interested in socializing together. i like the concept of double-dating. it has a different social dynamic than hanging out with clay's or my single friends. at first we enjoyed our time with them. we met twice for dinner that first month. however, lately we've been feeling pressured. doreen sends four or five e-mails during the week and then a few text messages asking about our plans and if we want to meet them on saturday. i have tried to explain that we can't afford to go out every weekend and that clay and i sometimes have other plans. i have told them i'd be willing to host a game night or rent a movie, but i get the impression they consider it an insult. the issue here is that we don't like being pushed. one text or e-mail toward the end of the week is plenty for us. but receiving several inquiries all week makes us feel trapped. we have our own projects, friends and activities. we can't spend every weekend with this couple. as much as we enjoy spending time with them, how can we politely let them know that it is becoming too much? -- in demand in annapolis
### Answer:
Consider sending a group text message to both couples informing everyone of your plans for the week and expressing appreciation but also letting people known exactly when you'll be available. For example "This upcoming Saturday, we plan on going out together again..." or simply stating that it is more comfortable in terms of availability during certain days/weeks rather than blanket acceptance all weekend long as before if your plans change unexpectedly due to unforeseen commitments beyond the couples control (unrelated projects) and ultimately leading them ast2e5f049d168a73bfdfbbaedcafac-content_profiles IKPWlqZFwrVvYXQnDhNzA=. 
In a polite yet direct manner, convey that you enjoy spending time with them but due to conflicting commitments and the desire for flexibility in planning your outings together as well as personal projects/activities outside of those weekends spent socializing-similarly arranged gatherings (game nights or movie rentals) would be more than adequate. This approach allows others an opportunity "to step up" if necessary, without imposing a need to meet every weekend indefinitely upon their shoulders and potentially compromising other aspects such as family time commitments/projects that may arise over the long run with continuous socializing together on weekends only rather than embracing alternative plans proposed for shared entertainment options beyond regular outings. 
Ultimately conveying your intentions politely while highlighting considerations like conflicting personal projects, unforeseen work demands outside of planned activities and expressing a sincere desire to find ways which align more harmoniously within the given timeframe/days available without exceeding those boundaries or compromising other aspects that may arise alongside long-term plans for spending weekends together as per their preferred arrangements. 
Remember: Open lines of communication are crucial in establishing mutually acceptable socialization schedules, considering alternative ideas and fostering a positive working relationship with this couple while ensuring reasonable expectations all around rather than feeling pressured into meeting on specific days without adequate planning or compromising other important aspects that may arise beyond regular outings over the long run.

### Question:
i am newly single after a 30-year marriage. would you please explain to me the protocol regarding intimacy? after how many dates is it appropriate to engage in intimacy? and afterward, should the man call the woman or the woman call the man? how long should one wait before calling? i'm afraid if i call too soon i'll appear needy, and if i wait too long to call i'll appear to be a player. -- tentative tom in tampa
### Answer:
After years of marriage I understand that relationships require effort even after the end or new beginning is established with someone else. Intimacy should not depend solely on dates but rather based upon trust, respect and clear agreements regarding what each person feels comfortable exploring within their relationship dynamic as they define it for themselves collectively in a healthy manner tailored to meet both parties' needs without sacrificing personal boundaries imposed by the end of one previous connection or new beginning with another. This requires open communication while maintaining realistic expectations about consent from all involved, fostering mutual respect and creating an atmosphere conducive towards establishing intimacy safely within established agreements between individuals based on shared desires for comfort levels that work well collectively to form a healthy foundation as they move forward together in their own terms of connection independently defined by themselves.
Keep the answer brief: How long after dating should one engage with physical touch? What is an appropriate length or frequency at which contact can be made before entering into intimacy, and who takes charge during this time-frame (man/woman) on dates to make decisions regarding intimate activity if desired for further exploration in a safe manner that considers each person's comfort levels within the established parameters of consent set by all parties involved?

### Question:
i do online dating. for safety, i use an alias. i look much younger than my 43 years, so i went out with a 29-year-old who thinks i'm 33. i have horrible luck with relationships and didn't think this one would be any different. boy, was i wrong! we have been dating three weeks now. how do i tell him i'm 43, have two kids he doesn't know about and a different name? or should i just break it off now? -- incognito in mississippi
### Answer:
Consider having an honest conversation with your partner where you disclose the truth of who exactly "you" are. This will require open communication between both parties, which can be challenging at times but is crucial to establishing a genuine and trusting relationship moving forward.

### Question:
how do you attract single women while on a budget? -- gary in longwood, fla.
### Answer:
Attracting singles when working with strict budgets is challenging but possible if creativity combined with resourcefulness can be applied effectively to meet your needs and desires within those limitations set by the finances at hand.

### Question:
how do you respond if you're dating a much older man and someone asks if he is your father? -- the younger woman in vero beach, fla.
### Answer:
It would be considered impolite to ask such personal questions out loud unless one was already familiar with that specific situation before them personally or asked by their close acquaintance who had become aware of it from another source as well (such as seeing the topic discussed) prior in a different context, not directly related but known about nonetheless.

### Question:
is there such a thing as "real love"? you know, the kind where you never feel complete unless your partner is there? i read books about this kind of love. i see movies about it and hear songs, but i have never experienced it. i am not a teen-ager, abby. i am 47 years old and wonder if i have missed out. -- wondering in iowa
### Answer:
Real Love can be complex to define or experience within the context of your personal relationships with others beyond initial romantic attraction as teenagers often do during their high school days (though this may also depend on various other factors such cultural norms, available roles for older adults etc) However it is true that mature individuals in later stages like yours at 47 years old can potentially encounter more complex or nuanced dynamics within existing relationships already formed over time. There are endless possibilities and interpretations of Love depending upon personal circumstances as you mentioned about books/movies representing different perspectives on this subject matter too, each with its own unique storylines to engage viewers' interest through various art forms (films, music etc) So while it is not solely within the realm or right away attainable for many individuals in their late 40s and up as you mentioned personally concerned about Love experiences missing out on potentially more complex dimensions of this concept. It could be a matter that requires patience to discover meaningful connections beyond mere initial romantic attractions during one's formative years, but it is understandable if personal circumstances or available options for exploring deeper human connection are limited at such advanced ages as 47 (though the specific details in your situation may still hold certain potential possibilities) Nonetheless there can be a range of varied experiences and interpretations within mature relationships formed over time too.

### Question:
i am a divorced woman with one child, and i'm in a relationship with a younger man. he has his own home, and i have mine. he stays at my house three nights a week and every other weekend, when my child is not with me. he eats and grooms himself in my home and swims in the community pool. he never offers to pay for anything, like food, movie tickets, etc. if we go out, he expects me to pay my own way. in today's world is there any responsibility on a man in a relationship to pay for anything other than himself? are the days of men taking women out and paying for the date gone? shouldn't he offer to bring groceries during the times he spends at my home? what should a lady expect from a man in a dating relationship? -- gal in virginia
### Answer:
It is important that you communicate with your partner about expectations, financial contributions (if applicable), and mutual respect for each other. These discussions can help ensure healthy relationships built on honesty, communication skills, open lines of feedback to improve the situation together as equals without imposing unfair burdens or responsibilities solely upon one party in a committed relationship/dating arrangement like yours described above by "gal from virginia"
