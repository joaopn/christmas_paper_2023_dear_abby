{"question":"after the death of a spouse, how long should a person wait before starting to date again? -- dottie in michigan","answer":"The usual period of mourning is one year. However, grief is such a personal emotion that no one can presume to make rules that will apply to everyone."}
{"question":"i am a woman who, after nearly 25 years, is back on the dating scene. those years were spent in a same-sex relationship. i just happened to fall in love with a woman. i have custody of our child from the union. i do not put a label on my sexual orientation. i would like to meet a nice man and pursue a new relationship. how do i let interested parties know about my past? being back in the dating world is difficult enough without having to explain an unusual history. -- back in the game in arizona","answer":"The subject of where you have been for the last 25 years is bound to come up early in a relationship -- or even before there's a relationship. My advice is to just be honest. And may I be frank? Some men will find the idea that you were with another woman titillating, while others may even find it a challenge. So don't jump into anything too quickly."}
{"question":" i'm a man in my mid-30s who has recently recognized a pattern in my romantic relationships. a few of them lasted for several years, before they ended for various reasons. in between, i've gone a couple of years before seeking out and starting a new relationship. in the in-between time, i go online and meet people i have no intention of meeting in \"real life,\" but who provide conversation and intimacy while i enjoy single life. i'm about to repeat the pattern again. i'm a few months out of a three-year relationship and have met someone online. it's great to chat online and over the phone, but we are not close geographically, and i have no intention of meeting in person. what's your insight on this, and do you think this is healthy for me? any ideas you can offer regarding this pattern? -- new relationships","answer":"I wish you had told me more about the circumstances of your breakups. Were they your idea or the other person's? If they weren't your idea, you may be using the in-between relationships as a safe form of entertainment while you are healing. I wish you had told me more about the circumstances of your breakups. Were they your idea or the other person's? If they weren't your idea, you may be using the in-between relationships as a safe form of entertainment while you are healing.\nIf you are upfront with the people you're meeting online, and they realize you have no intention of letting these friendships go anywhere, then I suppose they are healthy for all concerned. If not, then what you are doing shows not only a lack of character, but also a lack of sensitivity for the feelings of others, and it may be one of the reasons your long-term relationships aren't lasting."}
{"question":"i'm 20 years old and have never dated anyone. i have a lot of friends and do well in school and at work, and i try to be a good, kind, friendly person. what can i do to make myself datable? am i missing some crucial step in how to become a girlfriend? -- old maid in st. louis","answer":"Because I have never met you in person, I can't tell you what you might be doing that relegates you to the \"only as a friend\" category. However, some of your guy friends might be able to tell you. And you should also solicit some tips from your girlfriends."}
{"question":"it seems i will never meet my \"mr. right.\" every person i'm attracted to is either in a relationship or doesn't like me. my questions are: (a) when is it ok to just \"settle\"? and (b) do you have to be attracted to your mr. right, and\/or can you take the risk that the \"supposed\" sparkle\/love will come in time? -- tired of dating, landover, md.","answer":"My answer to question A is it depends upon what you mean by \"settle.\" If you have to ask yourself if you are settling, then you probably are -- and I don't recommend it. As to question B, \"love\" and \"sparkle\" are not the same thing. Unless you marry someone you truly LIKE, your marriage probably won't make it to the finish line. Marriage to the wrong person is like having a cellmate, not a partner."}
{"question":"my boyfriend, \"clay,\" and i recently met another couple, \"doreen\" and \"bob,\" who let us know they're interested in socializing together. i like the concept of double-dating. it has a different social dynamic than hanging out with clay's or my single friends. at first we enjoyed our time with them. we met twice for dinner that first month. however, lately we've been feeling pressured. doreen sends four or five e-mails during the week and then a few text messages asking about our plans and if we want to meet them on saturday. i have tried to explain that we can't afford to go out every weekend and that clay and i sometimes have other plans. i have told them i'd be willing to host a game night or rent a movie, but i get the impression they consider it an insult. the issue here is that we don't like being pushed. one text or e-mail toward the end of the week is plenty for us. but receiving several inquiries all week makes us feel trapped. we have our own projects, friends and activities. we can't spend every weekend with this couple. as much as we enjoy spending time with them, how can we politely let them know that it is becoming too much? -- in demand in annapolis","answer":"Doreen and Bob obviously do not have as full a social calendar as you do, and they love your company. It would not be rude to explain to Doreen that, as you so clearly stated in your letter, you \"have your own projects, friends and activities\" and \"can't spend every single weekend\" with them. You should also say that being snowed under with e-mails and texts makes you uncomfortable. Tell her that you enjoy them, too, that you have financial limitations and that you will contact them to schedule something. If they take offense because of it, the problem is theirs, so don't make it yours."}
{"question":"i am newly single after a 30-year marriage. would you please explain to me the protocol regarding intimacy? after how many dates is it appropriate to engage in intimacy? and afterward, should the man call the woman or the woman call the man? how long should one wait before calling? i'm afraid if i call too soon i'll appear needy, and if i wait too long to call i'll appear to be a player. -- tentative tom in tampa","answer":"When an individual has reached middle age, that person is considered mature enough to know when he (or she) is comfortable enough with another person to engage in \"intimacy.\" No time limit is engraved in stone. As to who should call whom first to offer congratulations on a fine performance, there is no reason to stand on ceremony. Everyone likes a compliment, and a prompt, \"Thank you for a wonderful time; it was great,\" is not considered needy -- it's good manners."}
{"question":"i do online dating. for safety, i use an alias. i look much younger than my 43 years, so i went out with a 29-year-old who thinks i'm 33. i have horrible luck with relationships and didn't think this one would be any different. boy, was i wrong! we have been dating three weeks now. how do i tell him i'm 43, have two kids he doesn't know about and a different name? or should i just break it off now? -- incognito in mississippi","answer":"Do not \"just break it off\" with no explanation. Tell the man what you told me -- that you have had such poor experiences with online dating that you used an alias, that you \"fudged\" about your age and that you have children. If it's a turn-off for him, you need to know it before you become more emotionally involved. P.S. Because many people on dating sites don't tell the whole truth, it's possible he not only won't be shocked but will have a few things to fess up about, too."}
{"question": "how do you attract single women while on a budget? -- gary in longwood, fla.","answer": "Matinees cost less for admission than late shows, and if there are any museums that are not too far away, check out free museum days. A picnic in the park or a day at the beach doesn't cost a lot -- and neither do outdoor activities such as biking or hiking. You really don't have to have a lot of money to attract a nice woman. And anyone who makes you feel otherwise is someone you should run from."}
{"question": "how do you respond if you're dating a much older man and someone asks if he is your father? -- the younger woman in vero beach, fla.","answer": "You just reply, no, he's someone you're dating. Say it with good humor and without being defensive. If there is a large age discrepancy, it's a logical question."}
{"question":"is there such a thing as \"real love\"? you know, the kind where you never feel complete unless your partner is there? i read books about this kind of love. i see movies about it and hear songs, but i have never experienced it. i am not a teen-ager, abby. i am 47 years old and wonder if i have missed out. -- wondering in iowa","answer":"You haven't missed out. What you have described sounds more like co-dependence than \"real love.\" Kahil Gibran said it best in his book, \"The Prophet\": \"... stand together yet not too near together: For the pillars of the temple stand apart, and the oak tree and the cypress grow not in each other's shadow.\""}
{"question":"i am a divorced woman with one child, and i'm in a relationship with a younger man. he has his own home, and i have mine. he stays at my house three nights a week and every other weekend, when my child is not with me. he eats and grooms himself in my home and swims in the community pool. he never offers to pay for anything, like food, movie tickets, etc. if we go out, he expects me to pay my own way. in today's world is there any responsibility on a man in a relationship to pay for anything other than himself? are the days of men taking women out and paying for the date gone? shouldn't he offer to bring groceries during the times he spends at my home? what should a lady expect from a man in a dating relationship? -- gal in virginia","answer":"More than you're getting. When someone is in a romantic relationship, there is usually some \"courting\" behavior involved. (Even birds of prey will bring their prospective mate a dead rat occasionally.) When two people care about each other, there is usually some give and take. But in your case you appear to be doing all the giving."}
