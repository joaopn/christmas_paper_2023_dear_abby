In terms of timing for intimacy, there isn't a hard and fast rule since every relationship is different.

This can be achieved through open communication, shared experiences, and getting to know each other on a deeper level.\n\nAs for who should initiate the call after intimacy, traditionally men are expected to reach out first. However, this is an outdated concept that doesn't necessarily apply to all relationships. Ultimately, it's about what feels comfortable and natural for both parties involved. If you feel like calling, go ahead! But if your partner seems content with waiting, respect their wishes as well.\n\nRemember, the most important aspect of any relationship is mutual respect, open communication, and a shared understanding of boundaries.

{"run_label":"abby","model":"TheBloke\/stablelm-zephyr-3b","question":" i'm a man in my mid-30s who has recently recognized a pattern in my romantic relationships. a few of them lasted for several years, before they ended for various reasons. in between, i've gone a couple of years before seeking out and starting a new relationship. in the in-between time, i go online and meet people i have no intention of meeting in \"real life,\" but who provide conversation and intimacy while i enjoy single life. i'm about to repeat the pattern again. i'm a few months out of a three-year relationship and have met someone online. it's great to chat online and over the phone, but we are not close geographically, and i have no intention of meeting in person. what's your insight on this, and do you think this is healthy for me? any ideas you can offer regarding this pattern? -- new relationships","answer":"It's important to recognize that repeating patterns can be a sign of unresolved issues or underlying needs. In your case, it seems like you're seeking connection and intimacy in between relationships without addressing the root causes.

Additionally, considering therapy or counseling could provide valuable insight and support in navigating these patterns.\nAs for the online interactions, it's essential to set boundaries and recognize that these connections are not equivalent to real-life relationships.

Generally speaking, the first few dates should focus on getting to know each other as individuals rather than engaging in intimacy. While it can be tempting to rush things, waiting until you both feel comfortable with each other is important for building trust and a strong foundation.\n\nAs for who should call after intimacy, this varies from person to person and situation. Some people prefer the man to initiate contact, while others may feel more comfortable if the woman reaches out first. It's essential to communicate openly about your preferences and expectations with each other. If you both agree on a particular pattern, sticking to it can help maintain clarity in your relationship dynamics.\n\nIn terms of waiting time before calling, this also depends on the individuals involved. Respecting each other's space and comfort levels is crucial. Holding off for a few days or even weeks after intimacy can show that you value the connection and are committed to building it together at a pace that feels right for both parties.\n\nRemember that there is no one-size-fits-all answer, and ultimately, the most important factor in any relationship is open communication, understanding, and respect for each other's feelings and boundaries.","system_prompt":"You embody the essence of Abigail Van Buren from the 'Dear Abby' column.
