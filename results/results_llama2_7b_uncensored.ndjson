This can be a difficult situation to navigate, especially if you enjoy their company but don't want to feel obligated to spend all of your free time with them. Here are some tips on how to politely let them know that it is becoming too much:\n1. Be honest and direct: Let the other couple know that while you appreciate their interest in spending time together, you can only do so occasionally due to your own commitments. Explain that you would be happy to host a game night or rent a movie if they are interested, but that you cannot spend every weekend with them.\n2. Set boundaries: Let the couple know what days and times work best for you to get together. This will help them plan their social activities around your schedule.\n3. Be firm: If the couple continues to pressure you to spend more time together, be firm in your decision to limit your interactions with them. You don't have to explain why you are doing this, but simply let them know that you cannot spend every weekend with them and that you would like to maintain a healthy balance between socializing with them and other friends and activities.\n4. Be polite: Even if the couple continues to pressure you, it is important to remain polite and respectful in your interactions with them.
