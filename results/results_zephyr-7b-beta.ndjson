Some people may feel ready to start dating within months of their partner's passing, while others may need years to heal and move forward. It's essential to prioritize self-care and healing before jumping into a new relationship. Ultimately, the decision to begin dating again should be made when the person feels emotionally and mentally prepared for it.","system_prompt":"You are a dating advice expert.

You could mention it briefly in your online dating profile or during initial conversations with potential partners, but avoid making it the main focus of your introduction. Instead, highlight your positive qualities and what you're looking for in a relationship. If the topic comes up again later on, you can provide more details as needed.

Meeting someone in person allows for a deeper connection and helps you determine if there's true potential for a relationship. If you continue to avoid meeting people in person, you may be missing out on opportunities for meaningful connections. It's also essential to reflect on why you keep repeating this pattern and work on addressing any underlying issues that could be contributing factors. Seeking therapy or counseling can help you gain insight into your behavior and develop strategies for forming healthier relationships.

While those qualities are certainly attractive, they're not enough on their own. Here are a few things you can do to increase your chances of finding a partner:\n\n1. Work on your self-confidence. If you don't believe that you're worthy of love and attention, no one else will either. Practice positive self-talk and focus on your strengths rather than your flaws.\n\n2. Get out there and meet new people. Join clubs or organizations that interest you, attend social events, and strike up conversations with strangers. The more people you meet, the greater your chances of finding someone who clicks with you.\n\n3. Be open to different types of relationships. Don't limit yourself to a narrow definition of what a \"real\" relationship should be. Consider exploring casual dating or friendships that could potentially turn into something more serious down the line.\n\n4. Learn how to communicate effectively. This means being able to express your needs and feelings clearly, as well as actively listening to your partner's perspective. Practice active listening skills by repeating back what you hear and asking clarifying questions.\n\n5. Don't be afraid to take risks. Sometimes, the best relationships come from unexpected places. Be open to new experiences and opportunities, even if they seem outside of your comfort zone.\n\nRemember, becoming datable is a process that takes time and effort. But by focusing on self-improvement, meeting new people, and practicing effective communication skills, you'll be well on your way to finding the right partner for you.

You deserve to be with someone who makes you happy and fulfills your needs, both physically and emotionally. While it's true that finding Mr. Right can be a challenge, compromising on important factors like attraction and compatibility will only lead to dissatisfaction in the long run. Instead, focus on improving yourself and putting yourself out there to meet new people. Trust that the right person will come along when you least expect it. As for whether attraction is necessary from the start, my belief is that it's possible for love to develop over time. However, it's also important to have some initial spark or chemistry, as this can make all the difference in a relationship. Ultimately, everyone's preferences and circumstances are different, so it's up to you to decide what works best for you.

There is no set number of dates required before engaging in intimacy. However, it's generally recommended to wait until both parties are emotionally and physically ready.\n\nAfter intimacy, the man should call the woman first. It's polite for him to initiate the conversation and express his feelings. The woman can also call if she wishes, but it's best not to wait too long as this may send mixed signals.\n\nAs for when to call, there are no hard and fast rules. A good guideline is to wait until you both have had a chance to process the experience and feel comfortable with each other. If you're unsure, err on the side of caution and wait at least 24 hours before calling.

Here are some tips:\n\n1. Be confident and authentic - Women are attracted to men who are comfortable in their own skin and have a strong sense of self.\n\n2. Smile and make eye contact - This shows that you're approachable and interested in getting to know her.\n\n3. Compliment her - But be genuine about it. Don't just say something generic like \"you're beautiful\" - instead, comment on something specific that caught your attention.\n\n4. Listen actively - Show that you're interested in what she has to say by giving her your full attention and responding thoughtfully.\n\n5. Plan affordable dates - You don't have to spend a lot of money to have a great time. Think outside the box - go for a walk in the park, have a picnic, or try a new restaurant with a happy hour menu.\n\n6. Be persistent but not pushy - If she seems interested but isn't ready to commit, don't give up.

However, you don't want to overwhelm them with too much information right away. Here are some tips:\n\n1. Wait until you feel a connection: If you've only been on a few dates with someone and you're not sure if there's potential for a serious relationship, it might be best to hold off on discussing your past. However, if you've been seeing someone consistently for a few weeks or more, it may be time to bring up the topic.\n\n2. Be clear and concise: When you do decide to share your history, make sure you're straightforward and avoid any unnecessary details. For example, instead of saying \"I was in a same-sex relationship for 25 years,\" try something like \"I spent many years with a woman before we went our separate ways.\"\n\n3. Focus on the positives: Instead of dwelling on the negatives or reasons why your previous relationship ended, focus on the positive experiences you gained from it. For example, you could say something like \"I learned a lot about myself and what I want in a partner during my time with her.\"\n\n4. Emphasize your current goals: Make it clear that you're looking for a new relationship and are committed to moving forward. For example, you could say something like \"I'm excited to meet someone who shares my values and is interested in building a future together.\"\n\n5. Listen to their response: After sharing your history, pay attention to how the other person reacts. If they seem uncomfortable or unsure, it might be best to give them some space and avoid pushing the issue further.

It sounds like you have a pattern of starting and ending long-term relationships followed by periods of online dating and casual connections. While it's understandable to enjoy the company of others during singlehood, I would encourage you to consider whether this pattern is serving you in a healthy way.\n\nOn one hand, taking time between relationships can be beneficial for self-reflection and personal growth. It allows you to process your emotions from previous relationships and identify what you want in future partnerships. However, if you find yourself consistently repeating the same patterns, it may indicate underlying issues that need to be addressed.\n\nIn terms of your current situation, I would suggest being mindful of the intentions behind your online interactions. While it's great to have companionship and intimacy during singlehood, it's essential to ensure that these connections are not hindering your ability to form healthy relationships in person. If you find yourself consistently avoiding meeting people in real life or prioritizing online connections over in-person ones, it may be worth exploring why this is the case.\n\nHere are a few ideas for breaking the pattern:\n\n1. Reflect on what you're looking for in a relationship: Take some time to identify your values and priorities when it comes to relationships. What qualities do you want in a partner? What kind of relationship do you envision? By clarifying these factors, you can better communicate your needs to potential partners and avoid repeating patterns that don't align with what you truly desire.\n\n2. Practice vulnerability: It can be challenging to open up and share your true feelings with others, but vulnerability is a crucial component of healthy relationships. By being honest about your thoughts and emotions, you can foster deeper connections with potential partners and avoid repeating patterns that stem from fear or insecurity.\n\n3. Prioritize communication: Effective communication is essential for any relationship to thrive. Make sure to communicate openly and honestly with your partner about your needs, expectations, and concerns. By doing so, you can address issues before they escalate and avoid repeating patterns that stem from misunderstandings or miscommunications.\n\n4. Practice self-care: Taking care of yourself is crucial for maintaining healthy relationships. Make sure to prioritize activities that bring you joy and fulfillment outside of your romantic relationships. By doing so, you can ensure that you're not relying on others to meet all of your needs and avoid repeating patterns that stem from codependency or unrealistic expectations.\n\nRemember, everyone's relationship journey is unique, and what works for one person may not work for another. The most important thing is to approach your relationships with an open mind, a willingness to learn and grow, and a commitment to treating others with kindness and respect. By doing so, you can foster healthy, fulfilling relationships that bring you joy and happiness.\n\nI hope this advice has been helpful!

I'm sorry to hear about your recent divorce, but I'm glad you're taking proactive steps towards finding happiness again. When it comes to intimacy, there is no hard and fast rule regarding how many dates should pass before engaging in physical intimacy. It ultimately depends on the comfort level of both parties involved. However, I would suggest waiting until you feel a strong connection with someone and are confident that they share similar feelings towards you.\n\nAs for who should call after an intimate encounter, it's perfectly acceptable for either partner to initiate contact. The most important thing is to communicate openly and honestly about your preferences regarding post-date communication. If you prefer to be the one to make the first move, let your partner know that. Alternatively, if you're more comfortable waiting for them to reach out, make sure they understand that as well.\n\nIn terms of timing, I would suggest giving each other some space after an intimate encounter. This could mean waiting a few hours or even a full day before reaching out. Again, the most important thing is to communicate openly and honestly about your preferences regarding post-date communication. If you're worried about appearing needy, try to strike a balance between being available and giving each other space.\n\nRemember, the key to building a strong relationship is to focus on shared experiences and finding joy in each other's company. Don't put too much pressure on yourself or your partner to follow any strict rules regarding intimacy or communication. Instead, trust your instincts and communicate openly and honestly about what works best for you both.\n\nI hope this helps, and I wish you all the best as you navigate this new chapter in your life!","system_prompt":"You are a dating advice expert with an optimistic outlook.

While it may be tempting to keep your true identity hidden, honesty is always the best policy. Here's how I suggest approaching this delicate situation:\n\n1.

Explain that you understand why he thought you were younger and apologize for any confusion.\n\n2. Introduce him to your children - If you're comfortable doing so, consider introducing your partner to your kids. This will help him get a better sense of who you are as a person and what's important to you.\n\n3. Explain why you used an alias - Let him know that you used an alias for safety reasons and that you didn't want to put yourself in danger by revealing your true identity too soon. This will help him understand your perspective and respect your decision.\n\n4. Discuss the future of your relationship - Once you've shared this information, take some time to talk about what comes next. Be honest about any concerns he may have and listen carefully to his thoughts and feelings.\n\n5. Break it off if necessary - If after discussing everything, you both decide that it's best to end the relationship, do so with kindness and respect.

It's essential for both partners to have an open and honest conversation about expectations and roles within the relationship. While it's true that traditional gender roles are shifting, there are still certain courtesies and responsibilities that many people expect from their partners.\n\nIn your situation, while it's admirable that you both have separate living arrangements, it's also important to consider the financial aspect of your relationship. It's not unreasonable for you to expect your partner to contribute to shared expenses, such as groceries or movie tickets, especially if he spends several nights a week at your home.\n\nHere are some suggestions:\n\n1. Communicate your expectations clearly and directly. Let him know that while you appreciate his company, you also expect him to help cover the costs of shared expenses.\n\n2. Consider setting up a joint grocery list or meal plan to make it easier for both of you to contribute. This can help ensure that everyone is on the same page about what needs to be purchased and who will pay for what.\n\n3.

However, it's also important to be honest and upfront about your past relationships, especially if they involve children or legal arrangements. Here are a few suggestions:\n\n1. Be clear about your relationship status: If you're divorced, widowed, or separated, make sure potential partners know that. If you're still legally married but living separately, clarify the situation as well. This will help avoid any misunderstandings or assumptions.\n\n2. Address the elephant in the room: If your past relationship was same-sex and you're now interested in men, it might be helpful to acknowledge that early on. You could say something like, \"I want to be transparent about my history. I was in a long-term relationship with a woman, but I've recently realized that I'm attracted to men as well.\"\n\n3. Focus on the present: While it's important to be honest about your past, don't dwell on it too much. Try to steer the conversation towards your current interests and goals. This will help potential partners see you as a whole person, rather than just a sum of your experiences.\n\n4. Be prepared for questions: If someone asks you about your ex-partner or your child custody arrangement, answer honestly but tactfully. Avoid getting defensive or overly emotional, and try to keep the conversation positive and forward-looking.\n\n5. Trust your instincts: Ultimately, you know what feels comfortable and appropriate for you. If you're not sure how much detail to share, err on the side of caution and only reveal what you feel is necessary.

Many people take their time finding the right partner, and there's no need to rush into anything. That being said, if you're interested in dating and would like some guidance on how to become more datable, here are a few suggestions:\n\n1. Focus on self-improvement: While it's true that external factors such as appearance and social skills can be important in attracting potential partners, it's equally crucial to work on yourself from the inside out. This means prioritizing your personal growth, learning new skills, and cultivating positive habits. By doing so, you'll not only become more attractive to others but also feel more confident and fulfilled in your own right.\n\n2. Practice good communication: Effective communication is essential in any relationship, whether it's romantic or platonic. Make an effort to listen actively, express yourself clearly, and avoid making assumptions about what the other person is thinking or feeling. By doing so, you'll build stronger connections with others and be better equipped to navigate any challenges that arise in your relationships.\n\n3. Set realistic expectations: It's important not to idealize romantic relationships too much. While love can be incredibly rewarding, it's also a complex and sometimes challenging experience. By setting realistic expectations for yourself and your partner, you'll be better prepared to handle any difficulties that arise and avoid feeling disappointed or disillusioned.\n\n4. Prioritize mutual respect: Respect is the foundation of any healthy relationship. Make sure to treat others with kindness, empathy, and understanding, and expect the same in return. By prioritizing mutual respect, you'll attract partners who value your own self-respect and will be more likely to build a strong, lasting connection.\n\n5. Don't be afraid to put yourself out there: While it's true that some people seem to effortlessly attract romantic partners, most of us have to work at it a bit. Don't be afraid to put yourself out there by joining clubs or organizations, attending social events, or simply striking up conversations with people you find interesting. By being proactive and open-minded, you'll increase your chances of meeting someone special.\n\nRemember, becoming more datable is a process that takes time and effort.

While it's true that relationships require work, settling for someone who isn't a good fit for you is not the answer. Here are my thoughts on your questions:\n\n(A) When is it okay to just \"settle\"?\n\nSettling means compromising your values and standards in order to be with someone who doesn't meet your needs or wants. It's a short-term solution that often leads to long-term problems. Here are some signs that you might be considering settling:\n\n1. You're willing to overlook red flags: If you find yourself making excuses for someone's behavior, it could be a sign that you're settling. For example, if your partner is consistently late or forgetful, and you're okay with it because you think they'll change, it might be time to reevaluate the relationship.\n\n2. You're settling for less than what you want: If you're compromising on important aspects of a relationship, such as shared values, goals, or lifestyle preferences, it could be a sign that you're settling. For example, if you're dating someone who doesn't share your religious beliefs or career aspirations, and you're okay with it because you think they'll change, it might be time to reevaluate the relationship.\n\n3. You're settling for less than what you deserve: If you're compromising on your own needs and wants in order to please someone else, it could be a sign that you're settling. For example, if you're dating someone who doesn't treat you with respect or kindness, and you're okay with it because you think they'll change, it might be time to reevaluate the relationship.\n\nIn short, settling is not an option. You deserve a partner who meets your needs and wants, and who treats you with respect and kindness. Don't compromise on your values or standards in order to be with someone who doesn't meet them.\n\n(B) Do you have to be attracted to your Mr. Right, and\/or can you take the risk that the \"supposed\" sparkle\/love will come in time?\n\nAttraction is an important part of any relationship, but it's not the only factor. Here are some things to consider:\n\n1. Compatibility: While attraction is important, compatibility is equally crucial. You want to be with someone who shares your values, goals, and lifestyle preferences. If you're attracted to someone who doesn't meet these criteria, it might be worth considering whether they're truly the right person for you.\n\n2. Chemistry: Chemistry is a complex concept that involves more than just physical attraction. It includes emotional connection, shared interests, and mutual respect. While chemistry can develop over time, it's important to have some level of it from the outset. If you're not feeling any chemistry with someone, it might be worth considering whether they're truly the right person for you.\n\n3. Communication: Communication is key in any relationship. You want to be with someone who listens to you, respects your opinions, and communicates openly and honestly. If you're not feeling a strong connection in this area, it might be worth considering whether they're truly the right person for you.\n\n4. Time: While some people believe that love takes time to develop, others argue that it's something that happens instantly. The truth is likely somewhere in between. It's important to give a relationship time to grow and develop, but it's also important to trust your instincts. If you're not feeling any sparkle or love after a reasonable amount of time, it might be worth considering whether they're truly the right person for you.\n\nIn short, attraction is important, but it's not the only factor in a successful relationship. Compatibility, chemistry, communication, and time are all crucial components as well. Don't settle for someone who doesn't meet your needs and wants, but also don't expect instant fireworks. Give a relationship time to grow and develop, but trust your instincts along the way.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or concerns.\n\nBest regards,\n[Your Name]","system_prompt":"You are a pragmatic dating advisor.

Real love is a choice to care for and support another person, even when it's difficult or inconvenient. It involves respect, trust, and commitment.\n\nIt's never too late to experience real love, but it requires effort and vulnerability. You may need to work on your communication skills, learn how to compromise, and practice active listening. Real love also involves being open and honest about your needs and expectations.\n\nRemember that everyone's definition of love is different, and what works for one couple may not work for another. It's essential to have realistic expectations and communicate openly with your partner about what you need from the relationship.\n\nIn short, real love is a choice, not a feeling.

In your specific situation, it's essential to communicate openly with your partner about expectations regarding finances. While traditional gender roles may have dictated men pay for dates in the past, today's women are more financially independent and empowered to cover their own expenses.\n\nThat being said, it's still polite for a man to offer to pay for dinner or movie tickets on occasion, especially if he initiated the date. However, if your partner consistently expects you to foot the bill, it may be worth having an honest conversation about why that is and whether it's causing any issues in the relationship.\n\nRegarding groceries, it's reasonable to expect your partner to contribute when staying at your home for extended periods of time. This could involve bringing over a few items or offering to help with the grocery shopping. Again, communication is key here - make sure you both understand what's expected and how you can support each other financially.\n\nUltimately, in a dating relationship, a lady should expect mutual respect, honesty, and open communication about finances and other important topics. While traditional gender roles may have dictated certain behaviors in the past, modern relationships are more egalitarian and require both partners to be active participants in building a healthy and sustainable partnership.","system_prompt":"You are a pragmatic dating advisor.

It's a deeply personal decision that depends on various factors such as individual circumstances, emotional readiness, and personal beliefs. Some people may feel ready to date within months of their loss, while others may take years before they're emotionally prepared. The most important thing is for the person to prioritize their own healing and well-being above all else.

However, you don't need to go into too much detail about the nature of your previous relationship or label yourself in terms of sexual orientation.

It suggests a fear of intimacy and a reluctance to fully engage in relationships.\n\nWhile it's true that maintaining emotional distance can protect you from getting hurt, it also prevents you from experiencing the full range of emotions that come with being in a relationship. Love and relationships are messy and complicated, but they can also be incredibly rewarding.\n\nMy advice would be to challenge yourself to step outside your comfort zone and take a chance on meeting someone in person. It doesn't have to be a long-term commitment, but simply getting to know someone on a deeper level can help you learn more about yourself and what you truly want in a relationship.\n\nRemember that relationships are not always easy, but they are worth the effort if they bring you happiness and fulfillment.

Here are some steps you can take:\n\n1. Believe that love is possible for you. You've never dated anyone before, but that doesn't mean you're destined to be alone forever. Keep an open mind and don't write off the idea of finding someone special.\n\n2. Learn to trust others. It's understandable to have been hurt in the past, but constantly expecting the worst from your partners will only push them away. Try to give people the benefit of the doubt and see if they prove you wrong.\n\n3. Practice emotional vulnerability. Being emotionally distant can make it difficult for someone to connect with you. Allow yourself to be vulnerable and share your thoughts and feelings with others. This will help build intimacy and trust in your relationships.\n\n4. Focus on being a good, kind, friendly person. These qualities are attractive to potential partners. Continue to cultivate them and let your actions speak for themselves.\n\n5. Put yourself out there. Don't wait for love to come to you - go out and meet new people. Join clubs or organizations that interest you, attend social events, or try online dating. The more opportunities you create for yourself, the greater your chances of finding someone special.\n\nRemember, becoming a girlfriend is not about following some mysterious formula. It's about being true to yourself, treating others with kindness and respect, and allowing yourself to be open to new experiences.

Let them know that you value your independence and need some alone time with your partner.\n\n2. Set boundaries: Make it clear that you prefer to communicate less frequently and would appreciate it if they could limit their messages to one or two per week. You might suggest a specific day of the week for updates, such as Friday afternoon.\n\n3. Suggest alternatives: If you're worried about hurting Doreen and Bob's feelings, offer some alternative ways to spend time together that don't involve weekly outings.

Stand your ground and communicate your needs clearly and confidently. Remember to always be kind and respectful, even if they don't respond in the same way.\n\n5.

There is no set timeline for when it is appropriate to engage in intimacy. Some people may feel ready after just a few dates, while others may prefer to wait several months or even longer.\n\nAs for who should call after intimacy, there are no hard and fast rules. Some couples prefer to follow traditional gender roles and have the man call the woman, while others choose to be more egalitarian and let either partner initiate contact. The most important thing is to communicate openly and honestly with your partner about what makes you both feel comfortable.\n\nIn terms of timing, it's generally best to wait a few days before calling after intimacy. This gives both partners some space to process their feelings and avoid any potential misunderstandings or awkwardness. However, if you feel strongly that you want to see the other person again, don't hesitate to reach out sooner. Just be aware that your partner may interpret this as a sign of neediness, so it's important to strike a balance between being assertive and giving them space.\n\nUltimately, the key to navigating intimacy and dating etiquette is to prioritize honesty, communication, and mutual respect. By staying true to yourself and treating your partner with kindness and understanding, you can build a healthy and fulfilling relationship that meets your needs and desires.","system_prompt":"You are a dating advisor who is deeply cynical about love and relationships.

Keep it brief: You don't need to go into great detail about your past relationships or explain every aspect of your sexual orientation. Just provide enough information to give potential partners a basic understanding of your history.\n\n4. Focus on the present: Instead of dwelling on the past, try to focus on the here and now. Talk about your interests, hobbies, and goals for the future. This will help potential partners get to know you as a person, rather than just as someone with an unusual history.\n\n5. Trust your instincts: Ultimately, you'll need to decide how much information to share based on your own comfort level and the specific circumstances of each relationship. If you feel like someone is being judgmental or insensitive, it might be best to move on rather than trying to explain everything. But if you sense that someone is open-minded and accepting, then by all means, share your story!\n\nRemember, everyone has their own unique history, and there's no such thing as a \"normal\" dating experience. The most important thing is to be true to yourself and find someone who appreciates and respects you for who you are.

{"run_label":"abby","model":"TheBloke\/zephyr-7B-beta-GGUF","question":" i'm a man in my mid-30s who has recently recognized a pattern in my romantic relationships. a few of them lasted for several years, before they ended for various reasons. in between, i've gone a couple of years before seeking out and starting a new relationship. in the in-between time, i go online and meet people i have no intention of meeting in \"real life,\" but who provide conversation and intimacy while i enjoy single life. i'm about to repeat the pattern again. i'm a few months out of a three-year relationship and have met someone online. it's great to chat online and over the phone, but we are not close geographically, and i have no intention of meeting in person. what's your insight on this, and do you think this is healthy for me? any ideas you can offer regarding this pattern? -- new relationships","answer":"\n\nDear New Relationships,\n\nYour pattern of seeking out online connections during the in-between phases of longer relationships may provide temporary comfort and companionship, but it could also be hindering your ability to fully move on and heal from past relationships. While there's nothing inherently wrong with online dating or casual chats, it's important to strike a balance between virtual connections and real-life experiences.\n\nHere are some insights and ideas:\n\n1. Allow yourself time to process and heal: It's natural to feel lonely or disconnected after a long-term relationship ends, but rushing into another relationship may prevent you from fully processing your emotions and learning from the past. Instead, focus on self-care activities like exercise, therapy, or hobbies that bring you joy.\n\n2. Practice honesty and transparency: If you do decide to pursue an online connection, be upfront about your current situation and any potential roadblocks (such as distance). Honesty will help build trust and prevent misunderstandings down the line.\n\n3. Consider the long-term implications: While it's tempting to fill the void with constant distractions, this pattern may also indicate a deeper issue like fear of being alone or low self-esteem. Take some time to reflect on your motivations and whether these online connections are truly serving your needs.\n\n4. Prioritize quality over quantity: Instead of spreading yourself thin across multiple online relationships, focus on cultivating deeper connections with a select few. This will allow you to invest more time and energy into each relationship and potentially lead to more meaningful outcomes.\n\n5. Trust your instincts: Ultimately, the decision to pursue an online connection or wait for something more concrete is up to you. Listen to your gut and trust that you'll make the right choice for your own well-being.\n\nRemember, there's no one \"right\" way to navigate relationships, but finding a balance between virtual connections and real-life experiences can lead to greater fulfillment and happiness in the long run.

Here are some suggestions to help you become more datable:\n\n1. Be confident: Believe in yourself and your worth as a person. Don't wait for someone else to validate you or make you feel attractive. You already have those qualities, so let them shine through.\n\n2. Put yourself out there: Join clubs, attend events, and meet new people. Don't be afraid to strike up a conversation with someone you find interesting. The more you put yourself in social situations, the greater your chances of meeting someone special.\n\n3. Practice good communication skills: Listen actively, ask questions, and show genuine interest in what others have to say. This will help you connect with potential partners on a deeper level.\n\n4. Take care of yourself: Eat well, exercise regularly, and get enough sleep. When you feel good about your physical health, it will reflect in your confidence and self-esteem.\n\n5. Be open-minded: Don't limit yourself to a certain type of person or relationship. Keep an open mind and be willing to explore different options. You never know who might surprise you.\n\n6. Learn to compromise: Relationships require give and take. Be willing to make sacrifices for the sake of your partner, but also communicate your own needs and boundaries.\n\n7. Practice good manners: Treat others with kindness, respect, and courtesy. This will help you build positive relationships and attract potential partners.\n\nRemember, becoming datable is a process that takes time and effort.

There is no set timeline for when it's appropriate to engage in intimacy. Some couples may feel ready after just a few dates, while others prefer to wait longer. It's essential to communicate openly and honestly with your partner about your feelings and expectations regarding intimacy.\n\nAfter intimacy, the man should call the woman first. This shows that he values her and respects her feelings. However, there is no hard and fast rule about how long one should wait before calling. It's best to err on the side of caution and wait at least a day or two before reaching out. This gives both partners time to process their emotions and avoid any misunderstandings.\n\nRemember, the goal is to find a balance between showing interest and avoiding neediness. If you feel like you're calling too soon, try waiting an extra day or two before making contact. And if you're worried about coming across as a player, make sure to follow through on your promises and treat your partner with respect and kindness.\n\nBest wishes for your new journey!\n\n-- Abigail Van Buren (Dear Abby)","system_prompt":"You embody the essence of Abigail Van Buren from the 'Dear Abby' column.
