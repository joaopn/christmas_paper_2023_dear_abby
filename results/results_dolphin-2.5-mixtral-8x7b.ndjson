It's important to be aware of our own behaviors and patterns, as it allows us to make conscious choices about how we want to approach future relationships.\n\nIn terms of your current situation, I think it's perfectly fine for you to engage in online conversations with people who are not close geographically. This can provide a sense of connection and intimacy without the pressure of physical proximity or expectations of meeting in person. It's important to remember that these relationships may not be as deep or meaningful as those formed in real life, but they can still serve a purpose in providing companionship and emotional support during times when you are single.\n\nHowever, if your intention is to maintain this pattern of online-only relationships without ever progressing to meeting in person, it might be worth examining why that is. Is it because you're afraid of getting hurt again? Or do you prefer the safety and anonymity of online interactions? Understanding your motivations can help you make more informed decisions about how you want to approach future relationships.\n\nIn terms of breaking free from this pattern, I would suggest taking some time to reflect on what you truly desire in a romantic relationship. What qualities do you value most in a partner? What kind of connection are you looking for? Once you have a clearer understanding of your needs and desires, you can start seeking out potential partners who align with those values.\n\nAdditionally, it might be helpful to challenge yourself by stepping outside of your comfort zone and meeting new people in real life. This could involve joining clubs or organizations related to your interests, attending social events, or even trying online dating platforms that encourage face-to-face interactions (such as video chats). By exposing yourself to a wider variety of potential partners, you may find someone who resonates with you on a deeper level and is willing to invest in a genuine connection.\n\nOverall, I think it's important for you to be open and honest with yourself about your intentions and desires when it comes to romantic relationships. By doing so, you can make more informed decisions about how you want to approach future connections and potentially break free from the patterns that have held you back in the past.","system_prompt":"You are a dating advice expert.

You're only 20! There are plenty of people who don't start dating until their late teens or early twenties, and there's nothing wrong with that.\n\nAs for what you can do to make yourself more datable, it's important to remember that everyone is different and has their own preferences when it comes to partners. However, some general tips that might help include:\n\n1. Be confident in yourself: Confidence is attractive to many people, so try to be comfortable with who you are and what you have to offer as a partner.\n\n2. Be open to meeting new people: Sometimes, the best way to find a date is by putting yourself out there and being open to meeting new people. This could mean joining clubs or organizations that interest you, attending social events, or even just striking up conversations with strangers in public places.\n\n3. Be genuine: People are often drawn to others who are authentic and genuine in their interactions with others. So, try not to put on a facade or pretend to be someone you're not when meeting new people.\n\n4. Take care of yourself: This doesn't mean you have to look like a supermodel, but taking care of your physical and emotional well-being can help boost your confidence and make you more attractive to potential partners.\n\n5. Be patient: Dating can be a frustrating process, so it's important to remember that it may take some time before you find someone who is right for you.

By expanding your social circle and engaging in activities that bring you joy, you may find it easier to form meaningful connections with others without relying solely on online interactions.

The key here is open communication \u2013 discussing boundaries and preferences with your partner will ensure that everyone feels respected and heard throughout the process.\n\nAs for who should call whom after a date, again, there are no strict guidelines. Traditionally, it has been expected that the man would take the initiative in reaching out to the woman following a date. However, modern dating culture is much more flexible and encourages both parties to express interest and communicate openly. If you're unsure about when or how to reach out, consider discussing this with your partner during one of your dates. This way, you can establish mutual expectations and avoid any awkward misunderstandings down the line.\n\nIn terms of timing for calling, there is no set formula either. Some people prefer waiting a day or two before reaching out, while others might opt for contacting their date immediately afterward. Ultimately, it's important to trust your instincts and go with what feels most natural to you. Just remember that prompt communication can help keep the momentum going in your budding relationship, so don't be afraid to take the initiative if you feel compelled to do so.\n\nIn summary, Tentative Tom, when it comes to intimacy and communication protocols in dating, there are no one-size-fits-all answers. The most important thing is to prioritize open dialogue with your partner, respect each other's boundaries, and trust your instincts along the way. Good luck on your journey back into the world of dating \u2013 may it be filled with joy, laughter, and many memorable experiences!\n\nWarm regards,\nYour Dating Advice Expert[\/INST]","system_prompt":"You are a dating advice expert with an optimistic outlook.

As long as you're being honest about your intentions and not leading anyone on, there's nothing inherently unhealthy about maintaining online-only relationships. It's important to remember that these connections may not be as deep or meaningful as in-person ones, but they can still provide a sense of companionship and emotional support.\n\nHowever, it's also worth considering whether this pattern is serving you well in the long run. If you consistently seek out new relationships after a breakup, it might be helpful to take some time for self-reflection and personal growth before jumping back into the dating pool. This could involve working on any lingering issues from past relationships or exploring what you truly want and need in a partner.\n\nUltimately, there's no one-size-fits-all answer when it comes to healthy relationship patterns.

If you find that maintaining online-only relationships is fulfilling for you and helps you navigate the ups and downs of single life, then there's no reason to change your approach. But if you feel like you're using these connections as a way to avoid dealing with underlying issues or emotions, it might be worth seeking out professional support or exploring other ways to process and heal from past relationship experiences.","system_prompt":"You are a pragmatic dating advisor.

It's not uncommon for people to start dating later in life, and there are plenty of reasons why someone might not have started dating by the time they're 20. Instead, focus on building your confidence and self-esteem, which will make you more attractive to potential partners.\n\nOne way to do this is to continue being a good, kind, friendly person. People are drawn to others who are positive and supportive, so keep up the good work! Additionally, try to put yourself out there more by joining clubs or organizations that interest you, attending social events, and meeting new people. The more you expose yourself to potential partners, the more likely it is that you'll find someone who shares your interests and values.\n\nFinally, remember that dating is a process of getting to know someone and building a connection over time. It may take some trial and error before you find someone who is compatible with you, but don't get discouraged if things don't work out right away.

This will help you attract people who share similar values and interests, making it more likely that you'll find someone compatible with you.\n\nAdditionally, don't be afraid to put yourself out there and take risks when it comes to dating. While it can be scary to open up to someone new, remember that everyone has their own insecurities and vulnerabilities. By being honest and authentic about who you are, you'll increase the chances of finding a genuine connection with someone else.\n\nLastly, don't forget to have fun! Dating should be enjoyable, not stressful or anxiety-inducing. So go out there, meet new people, and enjoy getting to know them without worrying too much about whether they'll become your next boyfriend or girlfriend.\n\nIn summary, focus on being true to yourself, embrace your interests and passions, take risks in dating, and remember to have fun along the way.

If you feel comfortable calling your date, go for it! Just remember that there's no need to play games or worry about appearing too eager.

You are not an \"old maid\" just because you haven't dated anyone yet. It's completely normal to be single at 20 years old, and there is no specific timeline for when someone should start dating or have a relationship.\n\nNow, let's talk about how to make yourself more datable. While it's great that you have many friends and are doing well in school and work, these qualities alone may not necessarily make you more attractive to potential partners. Here are some tips that might help:\n\n1. Be open to meeting new people: Sometimes, finding a date can be as simple as putting yourself out there and being open to meeting new people. Attend social events, join clubs or organizations related to your interests, or try online dating if you feel comfortable with it.\n\n2. Work on your self-confidence: Confidence is an attractive trait in both men and women. Focus on building your self-esteem by setting goals for yourself, practicing self-care, and surrounding yourself with supportive friends who uplift and encourage you.\n\n3. Develop your communication skills: Good communication is essential in any relationship. Practice active listening, expressing your thoughts and feelings clearly, and being empathetic towards others. This will not only make you more attractive to potential partners but also help improve your existing relationships with friends and family members.\n\n4. Be genuine and authentic: People are drawn to those who are genuine and authentic in their interactions with others. Don't try to be someone you're not just to impress a date \u2013 instead, focus on being true to yourself and embracing your unique qualities.\n\n5. Take care of your appearance: While physical attractiveness isn't everything, taking care of your personal hygiene and dressing in a way that makes you feel confident can help boost your self-esteem and make you more approachable to others.\n\nRemember, there is no \"crucial step\" or magical formula for becoming a girlfriend. Dating and relationships are complex experiences that vary from person to person.

In fact, some of the most effective ways to meet people are free or low-cost. Here are a few ideas:\n\n1. Volunteer: Find a cause you care about and get involved in your community. Not only will you be helping others, but you'll also have the opportunity to meet like-minded women who share your interests.\n\n2. Take up a hobby: Join a local sports team, book club, or art class. These activities provide opportunities for socializing and getting to know people in a relaxed setting.\n\n3. Attend free events: Check out websites like Meetup.com or Eventbrite.com for free or low-cost events happening in your area.

However, there's no need to be overly concerned about it. The best way to handle such a situation is to maintain your composure and respond with grace and humor. You could say something like, \"Oh, he's just my boyfriend \u2013 much younger than he looks!\" or \"No, he's not my father; we just share the same taste in fashion.\" Remember, people often make assumptions based on appearances, so don't take it personally.

Many people experience this kind of love at different stages in their lives. Keep an open mind and heart, and don't be afraid to take chances when it comes to relationships.

It's great that he respects your space and shares the responsibility of taking care of your home when he stays over. However, it is true that in today's world, there are different expectations for men and women in relationships. While some people still believe that the man should always pay for dates or offer to contribute more financially, others feel that both partners should split expenses equally.\n\nIt's important to communicate openly with your partner about what you expect from each other financially. If you feel like he should be offering to pay for things or bring groceries when he stays at your house, don't hesitate to express that to him. Remember, communication is key in any relationship!\n\nAs for whether the days of men taking women out and paying for dates are gone, it really depends on the individual couple and their values. Some people still enjoy traditional dating customs where the man pays for everything, while others prefer a more egalitarian approach where both partners contribute equally. Ultimately, what matters most is that you and your partner feel comfortable with how you handle finances in your relationship.\n\nIn summary, there's no one-size-fits-all answer to this question. It all comes down to communication and understanding each other's expectations and values when it comes to financial responsibility in a dating relationship.","system_prompt":"You embody the essence of Abigail Van Buren from the 'Dear Abby' column.
