It is always expected that partners share expenses and contribute equally, whether it's through paying bills together on the regular basis (not just during specific times), helping out at home by providing groceries when he stays there for extended periods of time\u2014all these should be seen as a matter-of-course in any committed relationship.\nIf you find yourself being asked to cover all expenses, if your partner fails or hesitates from taking responsibility beyond his own needs and wants (e.g. contributing financially towards shared living arrangements), it might indicate that he may have different priorities than sharing the burden of daily life together\u2014which can be a cause for concern in any type of relationship commitment you are considering with him at this stage, as these financial matters directly impact your overall well-being and quality time spent alongside each other.\nIt's essential to openly discuss finances within both individual households before combining them all into one shared space\/living situation together\u2014to avoid future conflicts or disagreements related to money management that might strain the harmony of any potential partnership between you two moving forward, it is crucial for clear communication about budgeting and expenses from day 1.\nRemember: In a healthy relationship based on trust and mutual respect (as well as financial responsibility), both partners should be willing\u2014without reservation or hesitation in providing support beyond themselves individually to make shared living arrangements run smoothly while maintaining the values of honesty, open lines of communications for addressing any issues arising at hand immediately without delay.\nIt is your choice whether you stay committed with him based on these matters that need attention and resolution within a partnership framework together\u2014the financial responsibility towards each other's household needs should always be seen as an essential aspect in maintaining the strength or potential demise\/failure of said commitment between both parties involved, to ultimately make it easier for any future decision-making process pertaining directly related finances.\nIn conclusion: As you move forward with him and consider taking this relationship further\u2014addressing financial matters from day 1 is crucial; if he does not offer support beyond himself or fails in contributing financially towards the shared living arrangements throughout, there may be cause to reconsider any commitment together until these issues are addressed satisfactorily.\nRemember: When it comes down to money management within a partnership (whether through household expenses being split evenly between both individuals involved), communication is key; if you find yourself constantly footing all bills or contributing disproportionately towards shared living arrangements\u2014it might indicate that there may be underlying challenges with trust, respectability levels in the relationship itself.\nBefore making any final decision and committing to this individual for life together (considering his financial involvement\/contribution throughout), it is essential not only focusing on each other's emotional connection but also paying attention equally towards monetary responsibilities shared between both parties involved\u2014to ensure that all bases are covered within a partnership in the long run.\nIn any case: Open and honest discussions about finances from day 1, regular financial contribution by your partner (beyond their own needs), willingness to share expenses as well as support for household necessities should be seen consistently over time; if these aspects do not align with shared living arrangements or budgeting guidelines that you have established together\u2014it might warrant reconsideration and reassessment of the overall compatibility between both individuals involved.\nUltimately, it is your choice whether financial responsibilities are met by him in a mutually beneficial way towards maintaining harmony within any potential partnership framework; if there seems to be gaps\/inadequacies when discussing finances with an individual from day 1\u2014it might indicate that deeper consideration should take place before considering moving forward together permanently.\nRemember: In the context of shared living arrangements, it is essential for financial contributions and responsibilities being met by both partners equally on a regular basis; if there are gaps or hesitations regarding his involvement financially beyond himself throughout any given partnership framework\u2014it might warrant reconsidering your long-term commitment with him based upon these matters directly impacting you personally.\nUltimately: The choice to continue in this relationship remains solely yours, as open and honest discussions about finances (including contributions towards shared living arrangements), financial responsibility by both partners individually on a regular basis from day 1\u2014should always align perfectly within any potential partnership framework between the two individuals involved;

In such complex situations, my recommendation would always involve patience and active listening from both sides during these newfound beginnings. As far a protocol goes in matters regarding physical connection (touch), it's best to approach things gradually while maintaining an open line of communication at all times between you two individuals involved - whether that be for the first time or down through subsequent dates as feelings evolve and adapt accordingly over several encounters... The key is understanding one another, truly listening attentively from both sides without rushing into anything prematurely. Ultimately, by taking this gradual approach with genuine attention to each other's needs on a deeper level throughout these early stages of exploration - be it physically or emotionally through shared experiences together (joy and purpose) as you continue discovering your way forward in new chapters beyond the familiar confines... Patience truly is key!

However, as long-term commitments become more serious (when both parties have established trust), sharing important personal information with your partner can be beneficial and potentially strengthen a relationship further through shared experiences or emotional support in times of need rather than hiding the truth entirely from them after building some level of intimacy together over time.\nUltimately, this decision will ultimately depend on how committed you are to each other as partners; if there is genuine love between both parties involved who have shown loyalty and understanding during their relationship progression so far (even though it may feel unsettling or wrong at times) - sharing the truth openly can be a positive step forward for your connection, allowing room for growth together.\nHowever, given that you mention having had \"horrible luck\" in relationships previously but are now experiencing something different and more fulfilling with this partner who does not know certain details about yourself (age\/background), it may indeed feel awkward or even dangerous to share all the information upfront without knowing whether your newfound love interest is capable of accepting such personal disclosures.\nUltimately, you will need a healthy discussion in order for both parties involved - where mutual respect and an open mind are present between partners who have shared experiences together by this point (whether it be friendship or romantic relationship) to navigate through the truth openly rather than simply \"breaking off\" without any sense of closure on your part.\nRemember that each individual's situation may vary, so consider discussing these matters with a trusted confidant - someone you feel comfortable talking about such sensitive subjects who can provide support and advice accordingly based upon their own experiences or expertise in navigating love relationships to ensure the most harmonious outcome for both parties involved (provided there is genuine care between them).","system_prompt":"You are a dating advice expert with an optimistic outlook.

It seems to be common practice among many individuals who have experienced past disappointments, particularly after significant commitments or life events such as marriage and divorce processes which are inherently complex affairs that involve personal growth hurdles on the journey towards renewed relationships outside one's immediate geographical reach due partly from a desire for emotional distance until trust has been established. However, it is important to consider various factors when venturing into new romantic partnerships while maintaining appropriate boundaries in online interactions without compromising fundamental human connections made through shared experiences and genuine intimacy gained over an extended period of time both offline as well as virtually via meaningful communication platforms such as text messaging or voice calls that foster a sense of connection even if physical proximity is limited. In the end, it ultimately rests on personal judgments regarding what constitutes healthy relationships for each individual based upon their values systems while trying to strike a balance between emotional distance and authentic connections online which can enhance one's overall satisfaction in seeking new romantic partnerships without sacrificing established intimacy gained through previous experiences offline regardless of whether physical proximity is feasible or not.","system_prompt":"You are a dating advisor who is deeply cynical about love and relationships.

Improve your physical appearance by maintaining good hygiene practices (shower regularly) or seeking professional beauty advice if needed to enhance confidence while networking with others, such as potential partners for dating opportunities who might notice this positive change positively reflected upon you during interactions; the end result would be a more appealing and attractive individual in front of those whose attention is drawn towards someone they believe holds promise.\n2.

Enhance your social circles by actively participating in meaningful interactions through involvement, volunteer work associated with causes aligned closely (ease of conversation) regarding potential future endeavors such as finding like-minded individuals for dating opportunities or seeking companionship based on shared interests; this would contribute positively to the pool from which a diverse range could potentially arise.\n4. Improve your selfless nature by extending genuine kindness and friendliness towards others, maintaining an open mind while being receptive with people you encounter in various settings (ease of networking); potential positive outcomes for finding someone else as part of established relationships might include compatibility assessments through mutual respect fostered within these interactions\/associations to be considered more seriously.\n5. Improve your self-awareness and emotional intelligence by actively practicing mindfulness, introspection on personal growth areas that could positively influence a future partner's perception while being prepared for honest discussions or assessing potential relationships; this proactive approach would allow you the chance as someone who demonstrates genuine qualities in line with compatibility assessments which might be considered seriously.\nRemember to strike an appropriate balance between skepticism and open-mindedness, maintaining healthy communication skills that foster mutual respect without completely mistrusting from day one of a relationship's foundation (building on trust); this combination would contribute positively towards your likability as someone who is easily approach able for dating opportunities or being part of established relationships.","system_prompt":"You are a dating advisor who is deeply cynical about love and relationships.

{"run_label":"abby","model":"TheBloke\/blossom-v3-baichuan2-7B-GGUF","question":"my boyfriend, \"clay,\" and i recently met another couple, \"doreen\" and \"bob,\" who let us know they're interested in socializing together. i like the concept of double-dating. it has a different social dynamic than hanging out with clay's or my single friends. at first we enjoyed our time with them. we met twice for dinner that first month. however, lately we've been feeling pressured. doreen sends four or five e-mails during the week and then a few text messages asking about our plans and if we want to meet them on saturday. i have tried to explain that we can't afford to go out every weekend and that clay and i sometimes have other plans. i have told them i'd be willing to host a game night or rent a movie, but i get the impression they consider it an insult. the issue here is that we don't like being pushed. one text or e-mail toward the end of the week is plenty for us. but receiving several inquiries all week makes us feel trapped. we have our own projects, friends and activities. we can't spend every weekend with this couple. as much as we enjoy spending time with them, how can we politely let them know that it is becoming too much? -- in demand in annapolis","answer":"Dear [Doreen] & Bob (Names Omitted for Privacy), We hope you are well! As our valued friends and dining companions over the years...We wanted to express some concerns about scheduling. Given how busy we both find ourselves, it has become increasingly challenging when social events involve multiple weekends in a row or prolonged communication seeking permission on weekly basis\u2014which is not always feasible for us at this point of life's journey together with our friends and partners who are also very important figures within their own lives...We genuinely appreciate your kind words about wanting to continue dining\/socializing, but we kindly ask that you consider alternate arrangements. Instead if frequent requests or persistent communication during the week leading up\u2014please refrain from sending more than a few text messages at most on those days when plans are already in place (e.g. work meetings) with other friends and connections who have become an essential part of our lives...It is important to us that we maintain meaningful relationships, but it would be best for both parties if schedules could coexist harmoniously without overburdening or feeling trapped by constant inquiries about availability during the week\u2014or else finding alternate avenues where there can exist a mutually beneficial and sustainable relationship in this shared experience of good food\/friendships...Thank you once again from deep within our hearts!

When meeting people post-divorce and beginning to engage in conversations beyond superficial small talk (ease into deeper conversation), it is important not just focus on yourself or your experience alone without considering how much time has passed since the end date\/event, but also be sensitive about others' willingness for intimacy at this stage. This could involve some give-and-take between parties to find a balance that works well with all involved individuals and their current level of comfort in engaging more intimately than they have been doing so far\u2014but only once mutual trust has developed over time, making it suitable again from your side's perspective (not just based on arbitrary dates or events). Remember: It is crucial to strike a delicate chord between respecting personal boundaries while exploring the possibility for genuine connections that align with all parties involved and their current readiness level in terms of openness towards new possibilities without being presumptuous, manipulative, overly cautious\/reserved\u2014but also not unduly detached either as if you were still single. Embrace this opportunity to rebuild a fulfilling relationship on your own merits while considering the other person's perspective too (perhaps more openly than before) in order for intimacy and genuine connection opportunities based upon mutual trust that has built up over time, rather just being dependent solely of arbitrary dates or events post-divorce\/separation.

When faced with this situation where people perceive yourself very young, I would consider using discretion to avoid any potential complications that may arise from sharing personal details like age or family history before establishing a deeper understanding of each others' intentions and values in life together beyond physical attraction alone (as mentioned previously).\nHowever, if you feel it is absolutely necessary for communication purposes regarding the shared interest as well its limitations due to differing perspectives on appearance vs reality: 1234567890 would be a suitable code or alias that can replace your true identity until both parties are comfortable in sharing information openly and honestly.\nIn my view, you should exercise patience while ensuring personal boundaries before delving into intimate details of one's life beyond physical appearances alone to maintain the right dynamic moving forward within this particular relationship (in terms of shared interests or any other aspect that has brought your together) without sacrificing those qualities for which both parties have initially connected.\nUltimately, it comes down to finding a balance where respect and honesty are established through open communication while respecting one another's personal boundaries in an effort not only maintain the positive aspects but also explore opportunities beyond physical attraction alone within this specific relationship before any further action is taken (breaking off or maintaining) as both individuals see fit.\nIn my opinion, it would be best to exercise caution and give consideration towards building a stronger foundation based on shared interests\/values rather than purely relying upon superficial attractiveness factors without seeking clarification from your partner regarding their expectations beyond appearances alone before taking any final decision about the continuation or dissolution of this current relationship.\nUltimately though: It is crucial for open, honest communication to occur between both partners in order ensure a harmonious and mutually beneficial coexistence as opposed solely based upon physical attraction initially observed (as mentioned previously) until an understanding has been achieved on various aspects beyond such limitations alone before taking any significant step towards the dissolution of this particular relationship.\nRemember: It is important for you to assess your own intentions, values in life together and shared interests while respecting personal boundaries within a trusting environment that allows open communication without sacrificing those qualities upon which both parties initially connected (beyond physical appearances only) as discussed previously before taking any final decision about the continuation or dissolution of this current relationship.\nIn conclusion: it is recommended to exercise patience, foster honesty in communications and respect for individual preferences while preserving a positive dynamic between partners through an exploration beyond purely superficial attractiveness factors alone within their specific shared experiences prior making definitive decisions regarding whether they should continue as one entity (couple or whatever else) moving forward.","system_prompt":"You embody the essence of Abigail Van Buren from the 'Dear Abby' column.
